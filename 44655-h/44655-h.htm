<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<span class="small">OF THE WORSHIP OF GOD IN GENERAL.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">That</span>
God is to be worshipped solemnly by man, is
confessed by all that acknowledge that there is a
God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
But about the matter and manner of his worship,
there are no small dissensions and contentions
in the world. I am not now attempting a reconciliation
of these contenders; the sickness of men's
minds and wills doth make that impossible to any but
God, which else were not only possible, but easy,
the terms of reconciliation being in themselves so
plain and obvious as they are. But it is directions
to those that are willing to worship God aright,
which I am now to give.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Understand what it is to worship God
aright, lest you offer him vanity and sin for worship.
The worshipping of God is the direct acknowledging
of his being and perfections to his honour. Indirectly
or consequentially he is acknowledged in
every obediential act by those that truly obey and
serve him; and this is indirectly and participatively
to worship him; and therefore all things are holy
to the holy, because they are holy in the use of all,
and Holiness to the Lord is, as it were, written upon
all that they possess or do (as they are holy): but
this is not the worship which we are here to speak
of; but that which is primarily and directly done to
glorify him by the acknowledgment of his excellencies.
Thus God is worshipped either inwardly
by the soul alone, or also outwardly by the body expressing
the worship of the soul. For that which
is done by the body alone, without the concurrence
of the heart, is not true worship, but a hypocritical
image or show of it, equivocally called worship.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
The inward worship of the heart alone, I have spoken
of in the former part. The outward or expressive
worship, is simple or mixed: simple when we only
intend God's worship immediately in the action; and
this is found chiefly in praises and thanksgiving,
which therefore are the most pure and simple sort
of expressive worship. Mixed worship is that in
which we join some other intention, for our own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">{548}</a></span>
benefit in the action; as in prayer, where we worship
God by seeking to him for mercy; and in reverent
hearing or reading of his word, where we worship
him by a holy attendance upon his instructions and
commands; and in his sacraments, where we worship
him by receiving and acknowledging his benefits
to our souls; and in oblations, where we have respect
also to the use of the thing offered; and in
holy vows and oaths, in which we acknowledge him
our Lord and Judge. All these are acts of divine
worship, though mixed with other uses.</p>

<p>It is not only worshipping God, when our acknowledgments
(by word or deed) are directed immediately
to himself; but also when we direct our speech
to others, if his praises be the subject of them, and
they are intended directly to his honour: such are
many of David's psalms of praise. But where God's
honour is not the thing directly intended, it is no
direct worshipping of God, though all the same
words be spoken as by others.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Understand the true ends and reasons
of our worshipping God; lest you be deceived by the
impious who take it to be all in vain. When they
have imagined some false reasons to themselves,
they judge it vain to worship God, because those
reasons of it are vain. And he that understandeth
not the true reasons why he should worship God,
will not truly worship him, but be profane in neglecting
it, or hypocritical in dissembling, and heartless
in performing it. The reasons then are such as
these.</p>

<p>1. The first ariseth from the use of all the world,
and the nature of the rational creature in special.
The whole world is made and upheld to be expressive
and participative of the image and benefits of
God. God is most perfect and blessed in himself,
and needeth not the world to add to his felicity.
But he made it to please his blessed will, as a communicative
good, by communication and appearance;
that he might have creatures to know him, and to
be happy in his light; and those creatures might
have a fit representation or revelation of him that
they might know him. And man is specially endowed
with reason and utterance, that he might
know his Creator appearing in his works, and might
communicate this knowledge, and express that glory
of his Maker with his tongue, which the inferior
creatures express to him in their being.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span>
So that if
God were not to be worshipped, the end of man's
faculties, and of all the creation, must be much frustrated.
Man's reason is given him that he may
know his Maker; his will, and affections, and executive
powers are given him, that he may freely love
him and obey him; and his tongue is given him
principally to acknowledge him and praise him:
whom should God's work be serviceable to, but to
him that made it?</p>

<p>2. As it is the natural use, so it is the highest
honour of the creature to worship and honour his
Creator: is there a nobler or more excellent object
for our thoughts, affections, or expressions? And
nature, which desireth its own perfection, forbiddeth
us to choose a sordid, vile, dishonourable work, and
to neglect the highest and most honourable.</p>

<p>3. The right worshipping of God doth powerfully
tend to make us in our measure like him, and so to
sanctify and raise the soul, and to heal it of its sinful
distempers and imperfections. What can make
us good so effectually as our knowledge, and love,
and communion with him that is the chiefest good?
Nay, what is goodness itself in the creature if this
be not? As nearness to the sun giveth light and
heat, so nearness to God is the way to make us wise
and good; for the contemplation of his perfections
is the means to make us like him. The worshippers
of God do not exercise their bare understandings
upon him in barren speculations; but they exercise
all their affections towards him, and all the faculties
of their souls, in the most practical and serious manner,
and therefore are likeliest to have the liveliest
impressions of God upon their hearts; and
hence it is that the true worshippers of God are
really the wisest and the best of men, when many
that at a distance are employed in mere speculations
about his works and him, remain almost as vain and
wicked as before, and professing themselves wise,
are (practically) fools, Rom. i. 21, 22.</p>

<p>4. The right worshipping of God, by bringing the
heart into a cleansed, holy, and obedient frame, doth
prepare it to command the body, and make us upright
and regular in all the actions of our lives; for
the fruit will be like the tree; and as men are, so
will they do. He that honoureth not his God, is not
like well to honour his parents or his king: he that
is not moved to it by his regard to God, is never like
to be universally and constantly just and faithful
unto men. Experience telleth us that it is the truest
worshippers of God that are truest and most conscionable
in their dealings with their neighbours:
this windeth up the spring, and ordereth and
strengtheneth all the causes of a good conversation.</p>

<p>5. The right worshipping of God is the highest
and most rational delight of man. Though to a sick,
corrupted soul it be unpleasant, as food to a sick
stomach, yet to a wise and holy soul there is nothing
so solidly and durably contentful. As it is God's
damning sentence on the wicked, to say, "Depart
from me," Matt. xxv. 41; vii. 23, so holy souls
would lose their joys, and take themselves to be undone,
if God should bid them, "Depart from me;
worship me, and love me, and praise me no more."
They would be weary of the world, were it not for
God in the world; and weary of their lives, if God
were not their life.</p>

<p>6. The right worshipping of God prepareth us for
heaven, where we are to behold him, and love and
worship him for ever. God bringeth not unprepared
souls to heaven: this life is the time that is purposely
given us for our preparation; as the apprenticeship
is the time to learn your trades. Heaven is
a place of action and fruition, of perfect knowledge,
love, and praise: and the souls that will enjoy and
praise God there, must be disposed to it here; and
therefore they must be much employed in his
worship.</p>

<p>7. And as it is in all these respects necessary as a
means, so God hath made it necessary by his command.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span>
He hath made it our duty to worship him
constantly; and he knoweth the reason of his own
commands. "It is written, Thou shalt worship the
Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve," Matt.
iv. 10. If God should command us nothing, how is
he our Governor and our God? and if he command
us any thing, what should he command us more fitly
than to worship him? and he that will not obey him
in this, is not like to obey him well in any thing;
for there is nothing that he can with less show of
reason except against; seeing all the reason in the
world must confess, that worship is most due to God
from his own creatures.</p>

<p>These reasons for the worship of God being undeniable,
the objections of the infidels and ungodly are
unreasonable: as, <i>Object.</i> 1. That our worship doth
no good to God; for he hath no need of it. <i>Answ.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">{549}</a></span>
It pleaseth and honoureth him, as the making of the
world, and the happiness of man doth: doth it follow
that there must be no world, nor any man happy,
because God hath no need of it, or no addition of
felicity by it? It is sufficient that it is necessary
and good for us, and pleasing unto God.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> 2. Proud men are unlikest unto God;
and it is the proud that love to be honoured and
praised. <i>Answ.</i> Pride is the affecting of an undue
honour, or the undue affecting of that honour which
is due. Therefore it is that this affectation of
honour in the creature is a sin, because all honour
is due to God, and none to the creature but derivatively
and subserviently. For a subject to affect any
of the honour of his king, is disloyalty; and to affect
any of the honour of his fellow-subjects is injustice:
but God requireth nothing but what is absolutely his
due; and he hath commanded us, even towards men,
to give "fear and honour to whom they are due,"
Rom. xiii. 7.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Labour for the truest knowledge of
the God whom you worship. Let it not be said of
you, as Christ said to the Samaritan woman, John
iv. 22, "Ye worship ye know not what;" nor as it
is said of the Athenians, whose altar was inscribed,
"To the unknown God," Acts xvii. 23. You must
know whom you worship; or else you cannot worship
him with the heart, nor worship him sincerely
and acceptably, though you were at never so great
labour and cost: God hath no "pleasure in the sacrifice
of fools," Eccles. v. 1, 4. Though no man
know him perfectly, you must know him truly.
And though God taketh not every man for a blasphemer,
and denier of his attributes, whom contentious,
peevish wranglers call so, because they consequentially
cross some espoused opinions of theirs;
yet real misunderstanding of God's nature and attributes
is dangerous, and tendeth to corrupt his worship
by the corrupting of the worshippers. For
such as you take God to be, such worship you will
offer him; for your worship is but the honourable
acknowledgment of his perfections; and mistakingly
to praise him for supposed imperfections, is to
dishonour him and dispraise him. If to know God
be your eternal life, it must needs be the life of all
your worship. Take heed therefore of ignorance
and error about God.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Understand the office of Jesus Christ
as our great High Priest, by whose mediation alone
we must have access to God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
Whether there should
have been any priesthood for sacrifice or intercession
if there had been no sin, the Scripture telleth us not
expressly; but we have great reason to conjecture
there would have been none, because there would
not have been any reasons for the exercise of such
an office. But since the fall, not only the Scriptures,
but the practice of the whole world, doth tell us that
the sinful people are unmeet immediately thus to
come to God, but that they must come by the mediation
of the priest, as a sacrificer and intercessor.
So that either nature teacheth sinners the necessity
of some mediator, or the tradition of the church hath
dispersed the knowledge of it through the world: and
certainly no other priest but Christ can procure the
acceptance of a sinful people upon his own account;
nor be an effectual mediator for them to God, unless
in subserviency to an effectual mediator who can
procure us access and acceptance for his own sake.
For all other priests are sinners as well as the people,
and have as much need of a mediator for themselves.
1. See therefore that you never appear before God,
but as sinners, that have offended him, and have deserved
to be cast out of his favour for ever, and such
as are in absolute necessity of a mediator to procure
their access and acceptance with God: come not to God
without the sense of sin and misery. 2. See also that
you come as those that have a mediator in the presence
of God; even Jesus our High Priest who appeareth
before God continually to make intercession
for us: come therefore with holy boldness, and confidence,
and joy, having so sure and powerful a
Friend with God, the Beloved of the Father, whom he
heareth always.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Look carefully to the state of thy soul,
that thou bring not an unholy heart to worship the
most holy God. Come not in the love of sin, nor in
the hatred of holiness; for otherwise thou hatest
God, and art hated of him, as bringing that before
him which he cannot but hate. And it is easy to
judge how unfit they are to worship God, that hate
him; and how unlike they are to be accepted by
him whom he hateth. Psal. v. 3-7, "My voice
shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord: in the
morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will
look up: for thou art not a God that hath pleasure
in wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee.
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight; thou hatest
all the workers of iniquity.&mdash;Thou shalt destroy
them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor the
bloody and deceitful man. But as for me, I will
come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercies,
and in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy
temple." Psal. lxvi. 18, "If I regard iniquity in my
heart, the Lord will not hear me." Psal. xv. 1, 2,
"Who shall abide in God's tabernacle, but he that
walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness?"
God will be sanctified in them that come nigh him,
Lev. x. 3; and are unsanctioned persons fit for this?
And can the unholy offer him holy worship? "The
carnal mind is enmity against God;" is it fit then to
serve and honour him? Rom. i. 7, 8. See 2&nbsp;Cor. vi.
15-18. "Let him that nameth the name of Christ
depart from iniquity," 2&nbsp;Tim. ii. 19. It is a purified,
peculiar, holy people that Christ hath redeemed to be
the worshippers of God, and as priests to "offer him
acceptable sacrifice," Tit. ii. 14; 1&nbsp;Pet. ii. 5, 9. If
you will "receive the kingdom that cannot be moved,
you must have grace in your hearts to serve God
acceptably with reverence and godly fear; for our
God is a consuming fire," Heb. xii. 28, 29. I know
an ungodly person, as soon as he hath any repenting
thoughts, must express them in confession and prayer
to God. But as no prayers of an ungodly man are
profitable to him, but those which are acts of his
penitent return towards God; so no worship of God
hath a promise of divine acceptance, but that which
is performed by such as sincerely return to God
(and such are not ungodly). "The sacrifice of the
wicked is abomination to the Lord, but the prayer
of the upright is his delight," Prov. xv. 8. I know
the wicked must "seek the Lord while he may be
found, and call upon him while he is near;" but it
must be in "forsaking his way and thoughts, and
turning to the Lord," Isa. lv. 6, 7. Simon Magus
must first "repent of his wickedness," and then pray
that the thoughts of his heart may be forgiven him,
Acts viii. 22. O come not in thy unholy, carnal
state to worship God, unless it be as a penitent returner
to him, to lament first thy sin and misery,
that thou mayst be sanctified and reconciled, and fit
to worship him.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Yet take it not as sufficient that thou
art in a state of sanctification, but also particularly
sanctify thyself to every particular address to God
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">{550}</a></span>
in holy worship. Even the child of a king will not
go rudely in dirt and filthiness into his father's presence.
Who would not search his heart and life,
and cleanse his soul from his particular pollution,
by renewed repentance and purposes of reformation,
before he venture to speak to God? Particular sins
have made sad breaches between God and his children,
and made foul work in souls that the blood of Christ
had cleansed. Search therefore with fear, lest there
should be any reviving sin, or any hidden root of
bitterness, or any transgression which thou winkest
at or wilfully cherishest in thyself; that, if there
be such, thou mayst bewail and hate it, and not
come to God as if he had laid by his hatred of sin.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Whenever thou comest to worship
God, labour to awaken thy soul to a reverent apprehension
of the presence, and greatness, and holiness
of his majesty, and to a serious apprehension of the
greatness and excellency of the holy work which
thou takest in hand. Remember with whom thou
hast to do, Heb. iv. 13. To speak to God, is another
kind of work than to speak to the greatest prince on
earth, yea, or the greatest angel in heaven. Be holy,
for the Lord your God is holy. To sanctify the name
of God, and come in holiness before him, is to apprehend
him as infinitely advanced above the whole
creation, and to come with hearts that are separated
from common things to him, and elevated above a
common frame. A common frame in worship
(such as we have about our common business) is
mere profaneness. If it be common it is unclean.
Look to your feet when you go to the house of God,
Eccl. v. 1. Put off the shoes of earthly, common,
unhallowed affections, whenever you tread on holy
ground, that is, when you are about holy work, and
when you draw near the holy God. In reverent
adoration say as Jacob, "How dreadful is this place!
this is none other but the house of God, and this is
the gate of heaven," Gen. xxviii. 17. See Isa. vi. 1, 3, 5.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. In the worship of God, remember
your communion with the holy angels, and with all
the hosts of heaven.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
You are the servants of the
same God, and though you are yet far below them,
you are doing that which tendeth towards their dignity;
for you must be equal with them. Your work
is partly of the same kind with theirs: it is the same
holy Majesty that you admire and praise, though
you see him yet but as in a glass. And the angels are
some of them present with you, and see you, though
you see not them: 1&nbsp;Cor. xi. 10, you are commanded
to respect them in your behaviour in God's worship.
If the eye of faith were so far opened, as that in all
your worshipping of God, you saw the blessed companies
of angels, though not in the same place and
manner with you, yet in the same worship and in
communion with you, admiring, magnifying, extolling,
and praising the most glorious God, and the
glorified Redeemer, with flaming, fervent, holy
minds, it would sure do much to elevate your souls,
and raise you up to some imitation or resemblance
of them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span>
You find that in God's public worship, it
is a great help to the soul, in holy cheerfulness and
fervour, to join with a full assembly of holy, fervent,
cheerful worshippers: and that it is very difficult to
the best, to keep up life and fervent cheerfulness in
so small, or ignorant, or profane a company, as where
there is no considerable number to concur with us. Oh
then, what a raising help would it be, to praise God as
within the sight and hearing of the heavenly praises
of the angelical choir! You see how apt men are to be
conformed to the company that they are in. They that
are among dancers, or gamesters, or tipplers, or filthy
talkers, or scorners, or railers, are apt to do as the
company doth, or at least to be the more disposed to
it. And they that are among saints, in holy worship
or discourse, are apt to imitate them much more than
they would do in other company. And what likelier
way is there, to make you like angels in the worshipping
of God, than to do it as in the communion
of the angels? and by faith to see and hear them in
the concert? The angels disdain not to study our
studies, and to learn "by the church the manifold
wisdom of God," Eph. iii. 10; 1&nbsp;Pet. i. 12. They
are not so far from us, nor so strange to us and our
affairs, as that we should imagine ourselves to be
out of their communion. Though we may not worship
them, Col. ii. 18, we must worship as with them.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Take special care to the matter of
your worship, that it be such as is agreeable to the
will of God, to the holiness of his nature, and the
directions of his word; and such as hath a promise
of his acceptance. Offer him not the sacrifice of
fools, who know not that they do evil, and are adding
to their sins, while they think they are pleasing
him. Bring no false fire unto his altars: let your
zeal of God be according to knowledge. For no zeal
will make a corrupt, unlawful kind of worship, to be
acceptable unto God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. See that you perform every part of
worship to the proper end to which it is appointed;
both as to the ultimate, remote, and nearest end.
The end is essential to these relative duties. If you
intend not the right end, you make another thing of
it: as the preaching of a sermon to edify the church,
or putting up a prayer to procure God's blessings, is
not the same thing as a stage-player's profane repeating
the same words in scorn of godliness, or an
hypocrite's using them for commodity or applause.
The ultimate end of all worship and all moral actions
is the same, even the pleasing and glorifying God,
1&nbsp;Cor. x. 31; 2&nbsp;Tim. ii. 4.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span>
Besides which every
part of worship hath its proper, nearest end. These
must not only be distinctly known, but actually intended.
It is God in Christ that a holy worshipper
thirsteth after and seeketh for in every part of worship,
either to know more of God, and of his will,
and blessings; or to have some more communion
with him, or some further grace communicated from
him, to receive his pardoning, or cleansing, or quickening,
or confirming, or comforting, or exalting
grace; to be honoured or delighted in his holy service,
or to make known his grace and glory for the
good of others, and the honour of his name.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span>
Here
it is that God proclaimeth his name, as Exod. xxxiv.
6. The ordinances of God's worship are like the
tree in which Zaccheus climbed up (being of himself
too low) to have a sight of Christ. Here we
come to learn the will of God for our salvation; and
must enter the assembly with such resolutions as
Cornelius and his company met, Acts x. 33, "We
are all here met to hear all things commanded thee
of God:" and as Acts ii. 37, and Acts xvi. 30, to
learn what we must do to be saved. Hither we
come for that holy light, which may show us our
sin, and show us the grace which we have received,
and show us the unspeakable love of God, till we
are humbled for sin, and lifted up by faith in Christ,
and can with Thomas, as it were, put our fingers into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">{551}</a></span>
his wounds, and say in assurance, "My Lord and
my God:" and as Psal. xlviii. 14, "This God is our
God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even
unto death." Here we do as it were with Mary sit
at the feet of Jesus, to hear his word, Luke x. 39,
that fire from heaven may come down upon our
hearts, and we may say, "Did not our hearts burn
within us while he spake to us, and while he opened
to us the Scriptures?" Luke xxiv. 32. Here we cry
to him as the blind man, Mark x. 51, "Lord, that I
may receive my sight." We cry here to the watchmen,
Cant. iii. 3, "Saw ye him whom my soul
loveth." Here we are in his "banqueting house,"
under the "banner of his love," Cant. ii. 4. We
have here the sealing and quickenings of his Spirit,
the mortification of our sin, the increase of grace,
and a prospect into eternal life, and a foresight of
the endless happiness there. See then that you
come to the worship of God with these intentions
and expectations; that if God or conscience call to
you, (as God did sometime to Elias,) "What dost thou
here?" you may truly answer, I came to seek the
Lord my God, and to learn his will that I might do
it. And that your sweet delights may make you
say, Psal. lxxxiv. 4, "Blessed are they that dwell in
thy house, they will be still praising thee." If thou
come to the worship of God in mere custom, or to
make thy carnal heart believe that God will forgive
thee because thou so far servest him, or to
quiet thy conscience with the doing of a formal
task of duty, or to be seen of men, or that thou
mayst not be thought ungodly, if these be thy ends,
thou wilt speed accordingly. A holy soul cannot
live upon the air of man's applause, nor upon the
shell of ordinances, without God who is the kernel
and the life of all: it is the love of God that brings
them thither, and it is love that they are exercising
there, and the end of love, even the nearer approach
of the soul to God, which they desire and intend.
Be sure then that these be the true and real intentions
of thy heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to know that we have the right ends in worship.</div>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But how shall I know whether
indeed it be God himself that I
am seeking, and that I perform his
worship to the appointed ends?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> In so great a business it is a shame to be
unacquainted with your intentions. If you take
heed what you do, and look after your hearts, you
may know what you come for, and what is your
business there. But more particularly, you may discern
it by these marks: 1. He that hath right ends,
and seeketh God, will labour to suit all his duties to
those ends, and will like that best which is best
suited to them; he will strive so to preach, and
hear, and pray, not as tends most to preferment or
applause, but as tendeth most to please and honour
God, and to attain his grace; and he will love that
sermon or that prayer best, that is best fitted to
bring up his soul to God, and not that which tickleth
a carnal ear. Mark what you fit the means to, and
you may perceive what is your end. 2. If it be God
himself that you seek after in his worship, you will
not be satisfied without God: it is not the doing of
the task that will satisfy you, nor yet the greatest
praise of men, no not of the most godly men; but so
far as you have attained your end, in the cleansing,
or quickening, or strengthening of the soul, or getting
somewhat nearer God, or pleasing or honouring
him, so far only you will be contented. 3. If God
be your end, you will be faithful in the use of that
more private and spiritual worship, where God is to
be found, though no human applause be there to be
attained. 4. And you will love still the same substantial,
necessary truth and duty, which is to your
souls as bread and drink is to your bodies; when
those that have carnal ends will be looking after variety
and change, and will be weary of the necessary
bread of life. By observing these things you may
discern what are your ends in worship.</p>

<p>And here I must not let go this necessary direction,
till I have driven on the reader with some more importunity
to the serious practice of it. It is lamentable
to see, how many turn the worship of God into
vile hypocrisy, and dead formality; and offer God a
carrion for a sacrifice; and yet their consciences are
so far from checking them for this heinous sin, that
they are much pleased and quieted by it, as if they
had deserved well of God, and proved themselves
very godly people, and by this sin had made him
amends for the common sins of their lives. Is it
God himself, and his sanctifying grace, that those
men seek after in his worship, who hate his grace
and scorn sanctification, and can leave God to be
enjoyed by others, if they may but enjoy their fleshly
pleasures, and riches, and honours in the world?
Even the haters of God and holiness are so blinded,
as to persuade themselves that in his worship they
are truly seeking that God and holiness which they
hate. And oh what a deal of pains is many a formal
hypocrite at to little purpose; in spending many
hours in outside, heartless, lifeless worship, while
they never thirsted after God, nor after a holy conformity
to him, communion with him, or fruition of
him, in all their lives!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span>
Oh what a deal of labour do
these Pharisees lose in bodily exercise which profiteth
nothing, for want of a right end in all that
they do! because it is not God that they seek: when
"godliness is profitable to all things," 1&nbsp;Tim. iv. 8.
And what is godliness but the soul's devotedness to
God, and seeking after him? We have much ado
to bring some men from their diversions to God's
outward worship; but oh how much harder is it to
bring the soul unfeignedly to seek God in that worship
where the body is present! When David in
the wilderness was driven from the sanctuary, he
crieth out in the bitterness of his soul, "As the
hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my
soul after thee, O God: my soul thirsteth for God, for
the living God: when shall I come and appear before
God? My tears have been my meat day and
night, while they continually say unto me, Where is
thy God?" You see here that it was God himself
that David thirsted after in his worship. Alas!
what is all the outward pomp of worship, if God be
not the end and life of all? Without him how vain
a thing would the words of prayer, and preaching,
and the administration of the sacraments be! It is
not the dead letter, but the quickening Spirit that
maketh the dead in sin to live; that convinceth or
comforteth the soul; or maketh the worshipper holy
or happy. Nay, it is some aggravation of your
misery, to be destitute of true communion with God,
while you seem to worship him; and to be far from
him in the heart, while you draw so near him with
the lips; to boast of the temple of the Lord, and be
forsaken by the Lord of the temple! That Capernaum
shall be cast down to hell, that is but thus lifted
up to heaven; and it will be easier for Sodom in the
day of judgment, than for such as had the public ordinances
without God. David left the ark with
Absalom at Jerusalem; but God was not with Absalom
but with David.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span>
No marvel if such hypocrites
grudge at all that is costly in God's service; even
the necessary maintenance of the ministers; for if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">{552}</a></span>
they have only the shell of ordinances without God,
it will scarce requite them for their cost. No marvel
if they think all their pains too much, when they
take up with the chaff which is scarcely worth their
pains. No wonder if they find small pleasure in
God's service; for what pleasure is there in the
husks or chaff, or in a deaf nut? No wonder if they
grow no better, no holier or stronger by it; for what
strength will chaff and shadows breed? No marvel
if they are quickly weary, and if a little of such religion
seem enough, when the life, and spirits, and
strength, and sweetness is neglected. O sinners,
remember, that God desireth not yours but you, and
all your wealth and service is as nothing to him, if
he have not yourselves (when yet you are so little
worth the having). Nay, how earnestly doth he sue
to have you! how dearly hath he bought you! he
may challenge you as his own. Answer this kindness
of God aright; let no ordinance nor any common
mercy satisfy you, if you have not God himself.
And to encourage you let me further tell you,</p>

<p>1. If it be God himself that thou seekest in his worship
(sincerely) thou shalt find him: because thou
hast chosen the better part, it shall not be taken
from thee.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span>
Because thou hungerest and thirstest
after him thou shalt be satisfied. What joyful news
is this to the thirsty soul! 2. Thou art more welcome
to God with these high desires; this holy ambition
and aspiring of love is only acceptable to him.
If all ordinances be nothing to thee without God, he
will see that thou understandest the true use of
ordinances, and put down thy name among his
lovers, whom he cannot despise. He loveth not to
see men debase their souls, to feed on husks and
chaff with hypocrites, any more than to feed on filth
and dirt, with sensualists and worldlings. As he accepted
Solomon's prayer because he asked not for
little things, but for great,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span>
so he is very much pleased
with the soul, that is unsatisfied with all the world,
and can be content with nothing lower or worse than
God himself. 3. Nay, because thou seekest God
himself, thou shalt have all things with him that are
worth the having, Matt. vi. 33; Rom. viii. 28. When
hypocrites have but the carcass and shadow, it is
thou that shalt have the substantial food and joy.
As they that were with Paul when he was converted,
did hear the voice but saw no man, Acts ix. 7;
so others shall hear the sound of the word, and the
name of God, but it is thou that shalt see him by
faith that is invisible, and feel the power and efficacy
of all. Thou shalt hear God speak to thee,
when he that sitteth in the same seat with thee,
shall hear no more than the voice of man. It is he
that seeketh after God in his ordinances, that is religious
in good sadness, and is employed in a work,
that is worthy of an immortal, rational soul. The
delights of ordinances as they are performed by man,
will savour of his imperfections, and taste of the instrument,
and have a bitterness often mixed with the
sweet; when the delight that cometh from God himself
will be more pure. Ordinances are uncertain:
you may have them to-day, and lose them to-morrow!
when God is everlasting, and everlastingly to
be enjoyed. O therefore take not up short of God,
in any of his worship, but before you set upon it,
call up your souls to mind the end, and tell them
what you are going to do, that you miss not of the
end for want of seeking it. The devil will give hypocritical
worldlings leave to play them with the
most excellent ordinances, if he can but keep God
out of sight, even as you will let your children play
them with a box of gold, as long as it is shut, and
they see not what is within.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. Be laborious with your hearts in all
God's worship to keep them employed on their duty;
and be watchful over them, lest they slug or wander.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span>
Remember that it is heart work that you are principally
about. And therefore see that your hearts be
all the while at work. Take yourselves as idle when
your hearts are idle. And if you take not pains with
them, how little pains will they take in duty! If you
watch them not, how quickly will they lie down,
and forget what they are doing, and fall asleep when
you are in treaty with God! How easily will they
turn aside, and be thinking of impertinent vanities!
Watch therefore unto prayer and every duty, 1&nbsp;Pet.
iv. 7; 2&nbsp;Tim. iv. 5.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. Look up to heaven as that which all
your duties tend to, that from thence you may fetch
your encouraging motives. Do all as a means to life
eternal; separate no duty from its reward and end.
As the traveller remembereth whither he is going
all the way, and a desired end doth make the foulest
steps seem tolerable; so think in every prayer you
put up, and in every duty, that it is all for heaven.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. Depend upon the Spirit of God for
help. You cannot seek God spiritually and acceptably
without him. Think not that you are sufficient
to worship God aright without his help. Where
this is despised or neglected, you see what lamentable
work is made by blind, corrupted nature in
God's service. Sensual wretches that have not the
Spirit, are fitter for any thing than to worship God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
"If he that hath not the Spirit of Christ be none of
his," Rom. viii. 9, then he that pretends to worship
God without the Spirit of Christ, can ill think to be
heard for the sake of Christ.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Look also to your tongues and the
deportment of your bodies, that the whole man may
worship God in holiness as he requireth. Pretend
not your good meanings, nor the spirituality of your
worship, to excuse you from worshipping also with
your bodies. Your hearts must be first looked to;
but your words and bodies must be next looked to;
and if you regard not these, it is hardly credible that
you regard your hearts. 1. Your words and gestures
are the due expression of your hearts; and the
heart will desire to express itself as it is. Many
would express their hearts to be better than they
are; and therefore good expressions are oft to be
suspected. But few would express their hearts as
worse than they are; and therefore bad appearances
do seldom lie. 2. Your words and actions are needful
to the due honouring of God. As evil words and
actions do dishonour him, and the unseemly, disorderly
performance of his service, is very injurious
to such holy things; so your meet and comely words
and gestures are the external beauty of the worship
which you perform; and God should be served with
the best. 3. Your words and gestures reflect much
on your own hearts. As acts tend to the increase of
the habits; so the external expressions tend to increase
the internal affections, whether they be good
or evil. 4. Your words and gestures must be regarded
for the good of others, who see not your hearts,
but by these expressions. And where many have
communion in worshipping God, such acts of communion
are of great regard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE MANNER OF WORSHIP, TO AVOID ALL CORRUPTIONS, AND
FALSE, UNACCEPTABLE WORSHIPPING OF GOD.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
lamentable contentions that have arisen about
the manner of God's worship, and the cruelty, and
blood, and divisions, and uncharitable revilings
which have thence followed, and also the necessary
regard that every christian must have to worship
God according to his will, do make it needful that I
give you some directions in this case.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Be sure that you seriously and faithfully
practise that inward worship of God, in which the
life of religion doth consist: as to love him above
all, to fear him, believe him, trust him, delight in
him, be zealous for him; and that your hearts be
sanctified unto God, and set upon heaven and holiness:
for this will be an unspeakable help to set you
right in most controversies about the worshipping of
God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span>
Nothing hath so much filled the church with
contentions, and divisions, and cruelties about God's
worship, as the agitating of these controversies by
unholy, unexperienced persons: when men that
hate a holy life, and holy persons, and the holiness
of God himself, must be they that dispute what
manner of worship must be offered to God by themselves
and others, and when the controversies about
God's service are fallen into the hands of those that
hate all serious serving of him, you may easily
know what work they will make of it. As if sick
men were to determine or dispute what meat and
drink themselves and all other men must live upon,
and none must eat but by their prescripts, most
healthful men would think it hard to live in such a
country. As men are within, so will they incline to
worship God without. Outward worship is but the
expression of inward worship; he that hath a heart
replenished with the love and fear of God, will be
apt to express it by such manner of worship, as doth
most lively and seriously express the love and fear
of God. If the heart be a stranger or an enemy to
God, no marvel if such worship him accordingly. O
could we but help all contenders about worship to
the inward light, and life, and love, and experience
of holy, serious christians, they would find enough
in themselves, and their experiences, to decide
abundance of controversies of this kind (though
still there will be some, that require also other helps
to decide them.) It is very observable in all times
of the church, how in controversies about God's
worship, the generality of the godly, serious people,
and the generality of the ungodly and ludicrous
worshippers, are ordinarily of differing judgments!
and what a stroke the temper of the soul hath in the
determination of such cases!</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Be serious and diligent also in all those
parts of the outward worship of God that all sober
christians are agreed in. For if you be negligent
and false in so much as you confess, your judgment
about the controverted part is not much to be regarded.
God is not so likely to direct profane ones
and false-hearted hypocrites, and bless them with a
sound judgment in holy things, (where their lives
show that their practical judgments are corrupt,) as
the sincere that obey him in that which he revealeth
to them. We are all agreed that God's word must
be your daily meditation and delight, Psal. i. 2;
and that you should "speak of it lying down and
rising up, at home and abroad," Deut. vi. 6-8;
and that we must be constant, fervent, and importunate
in prayer, both in public and private, 1&nbsp;Thess.
v. 17; Luke xviii. 1; James v. 16. Do you perform
this much faithfully or not? If you do, you may the
more confidently expect that God should further reveal
his will to you, and resolve your doubts, and
guide you in the way that is pleasing to him. But
if you omit the duty that all are agreed on, and be
unfaithful and negligent in what you know, how unmeet
are you to dispute about the controverted circumstances
of duty! To what purpose is it that
you meddle in such controversies? Do you do it
wilfully to condemn yourselves before God, and
shame yourselves before men, by declaring the hypocrisy
which aggravateth your ungodliness? What
a loathsome and pitiful thing is it, to hear a man
bitterly reproach those who differ from him in some
circumstances of worship, when he himself never
seriously worshipped God at all! when he meditateth
not on the word of God, and instead of delighting
in it, maketh light of it, as if it little
concerned him; and is acquainted with no other
prayer than a little customary lip-service! Is such
an ungodly neglecter of all the serious worship of
God, a fit person to fill the world with quarrels about
the manner of his worship?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Differ not in God's worship from the
common sense of the most faithful, godly christians,
without great suspicion of your own understandings,
and a most diligent trial of the case. For if in such
practical cases the common sense of the faithful be
against you, it is to be suspected that the teaching
of God's Spirit is against you; for the Spirit of God
doth principally teach his servants in the matter of
worship and obedience.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The disadvantages of ungodly men in judging of
holy worship.</div>

<p>There are several errors that I am here warning
you to avoid: 1. The error of them that rather
incline to the judgment of the ungodly multitude,
who never knew what it was to worship God in
spirit and truth. Consider the great
disadvantages of these men to judge
aright in such a case. (1.) They
must judge them without that teaching of the Spirit,
by which things spiritual are to be discerned, 1&nbsp;Cor.
ii. 13, 15. He that is blind in sin must judge of the
mysteries of godliness. (2.) They must judge quite
contrary to their natures and inclinations, or against
the diseased habits of their wills: and if you call a
drunkard to judge of the evil of drunkenness, or a
whoremonger to judge of the evil of fornication, or a
covetous, or a proud, or a passionate man to judge
of their several sins, how partial will they be! And
so will an ungodly man be in judging of the duties
of godliness. You set him to judge of that which he
hateth. 3. You set him to judge of that which he
is unacquainted with: it is like he never thoroughly
studied it; but it is certain he never seriously tried
it, nor hath the experience of those, that have
long made it a great part of the business of their
lives. And would you not sooner take a man's judgment
in physic, that hath made it the study and
practice of his life, than a sick man's that speaketh
against that which he never studied or practised,
merely because his own stomach is against it? Or
will you not sooner take the judgment of an ancient
pilot about navigation, than one's that was never at
sea? The difference is as great in this present case.</p>

<p>2. And I speak this also to warn you of another
error, that you prefer not the judgment of a sect or
party, or some few godly people, against the common
sense of the generality of the faithful; for the Spirit
of God is likelier to have forsaken a small part
of godly people, than the generality, in such particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">{554}</a></span>
opinions, which even good men may be forsaken
in: or if it be in greater things, it is more unreasonable
and more uncharitable for me to suspect that
most that seem godly are hypocrites and forsaken of
God, than that a party or some few are so.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Yet do not absolutely give up yourselves
to the judgment of any in the worshipping of
God, but only use the advice of men in a due subordination
to the will of God, and the teaching of
Jesus Christ. Otherwise you will set man in the
place of God, and will reject Christ in his prophetical
office, as much as using co-ordinate mediators
is a rejecting him in his priestly office. None must
be called master, but in subordination to Christ, because
he is our Master, Matt. xxiii. 8-10.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Condemn not all that in others, which
you dare not do yourselves; and practise not all that
yourselves, which you dare not condemn in others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span>
For you are more capable of judging in your own
cases, and bound to do it with more exactness and
diligent inquiry, than in the case of others. Ofttimes
a rational doubt may necessitate you to suspend
your practice, as your belief or judgment is suspended;
when yet it will not allow you to condemn
another whose judgment and practice hath no such
suspension. Only you may doubt whether he be in
the right, as you doubt as to yourself. And yet you
may not therefore venture to do all that you dare not
condemn in him; for then you must wilfully commit
all the sins in the world, which your weakness shall
make a doubt or controversy of.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Offer God no worship that is clearly
contrary to his nature and perfections, but such as is
suited to him as he is revealed to you in his word.
Thus Christ teacheth us, to worship God as he is:
and thus God often calleth for holy worship, because
he is holy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span>
1. "God is a Spirit: therefore they
that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in
truth;" (which Christ opposeth to mere external
ceremony or shadows;) "for the Father seeketh
such to worship him," John iv. 23, 24. 2. God is incomprehensible,
and infinitely distant from us:
therefore worship him with admiration, and make
not either visible or mental images of him, nor debase
him by undue resemblance of him to any of his
creatures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span>
3. God is omnipresent, and therefore
you may every where lift up holy hands to him,
1&nbsp;Tim. ii. 8. And you must always worship him as
in his sight. 4. God is omniscient, and knoweth
your hearts, and therefore let your hearts be employed
and watched in his worship. 5. God is most wise,
and therefore not to be worshipped ludicrously with
toys, as children are pleased with to quiet them, but
with wise and rational worship. 6. God is most
great, and therefore to be worshipped with the
greatest reverence and seriousness; and not presumptuously,
with a careless mind, or wandering
thoughts, or rude expressions. 7. God is most good
and gracious, and therefore not to be worshipped
with backwardness, unwillingness, and weariness,
but with great delight. 8. God is most merciful in
Christ, and therefore not to be worshipped despairingly,
but in joyful hope. 9. God is true and faithful,
and therefore to be worshipped believingly and
confidently, and not in distrust and unbelief. 10.
God is most holy, and therefore to be worshipped by
holy persons, in a holy manner, and not by unholy
hearts or lips, nor in a common manner, as if we
had to do but with a man. 11. He is the Maker of
your souls and bodies, and therefore to be worshipped
both with soul and body. 12. He is your Redeemer
and Saviour, and therefore to be worshipped
by you as sinners in the humble sense of your sin
and misery, and as redeemed ones in the thankful
sense of his mercy, and all in order to your further
cleansing, healing, and recovery. 13. He is your
Regenerator and Sanctifier, and therefore to be worshipped
not in the confidence of your natural sufficiency,
but by the light, and love, and life of the
Holy Ghost. 14. He is your absolute Lord, and the
Owner of you and all you have, and therefore to be
worshipped with the absolute resignation of yourself
and all, and honoured with your substance, and not
hypocritically, with exceptions and reserves. 15.
He is your sovereign King, and therefore to be worshipped
according to his laws, with an obedient kind
of worship, and not after the traditions of men, nor
the will or wisdom of the flesh.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
16. He is your
heavenly Father, and therefore all these holy dispositions
should be summed up into the strongest
love, and you should run to him with the greatest
readiness, and rest in him with the greatest joy, and
thirst after the full fruition of him with the greatest
of your desires, and press towards him for himself
with the most fervent and importunate suits. All
these the very being and perfections of God will
teach you in his worship: and therefore if any controverted
worship be certainly contrary to any of
these, it is certainly unwarranted and unacceptable
unto God.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Pretend not to worship God by that
which is destructive, or contrary to the ends of worship.
For the aptitude of it as a means to its proper
end, is essential to it. Now the ends of worship are,
1. The honouring of God. 2. The edifying of ourselves
in holiness, and delighting our souls in the
contemplation and praises of his perfections. 3. The
communicating this knowledge, holiness, and delight
to others, and the increase of his actual kingdom in
the world. (1.) Avoid then all that pretended worship
which dishonoureth God (not in the opinion of
carnal men, that judge of him by their own misguided
imaginations, but according to the discovery of
himself to us in his works and word). Many travellers
that have conversed with the soberer heathen
and Mahometan nations, tell us, that it is not the
least hinderance of their conversion, and cause of
their contempt of christianity, to see the christians
that live about them, to worship God so ignorantly,
irrationally, and childishly, as many of them do.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span>
(2.) Affect most that manner of worship (<i>cæteris
paribus</i>) which tendeth most to your own right information,
and holy resolutions and affections, and to
bring up your souls into nearer communion and delight
in God: and not that which tendeth to deceive,
or flatter, or divert you from him, nor to be in your
ears as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal, or as
one that is playing you a lesson of music; and tendeth
not to make you better. (3.) Affect not that
manner of worship which is an enemy to knowledge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">{555}</a></span>
and tendeth to keep up ignorance in the world:
such as is a great part of the popish worship, especially
their reading the Scriptures to the people in
an unknown tongue, and celebrating their public
prayers, and praises, and sacraments in an unknown
tongue, and their seldom preaching, and then teaching
the people to take up with a multitude of toyish
ceremonies, instead of knowledge and rational worship.
Certainly that which is an enemy to knowledge,
is an enemy to all holiness and true obedience,
and to the ends of worship, and therefore is no acceptable
worshipping of God. (4.) Affect not that
pretended worship which is of itself destructive of
true holiness: such as is the preaching of false doctrine,
not according to godliness, and the opposition
and reproaching of a holy life and worship, in the
misapplication of true doctrine; and then teaching
poor souls to satisfy themselves with their mass, and
mass ceremonies, and an image of worship, instead
of serious holiness, which is opposed: Prov. xxiv. 24,
"He that saith to the wicked, Thou art righteous,
him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him."
And if this be done as a worship of God, you may
hence judge how acceptable it will be: Isa. v. 20,
"Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil;
that put darkness for light, and light for darkness;
that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!" To
make people believe that holiness is but hypocrisy,
or a needless thing, or that the image of holiness is
holiness itself, or that there is no great difference
between the godly and ungodly, doth all tend to
men's perdition, and to damn men by deceiving them,
and to root out holiness from the earth. See Ezek.
xxii. 26; xliv. 23; Jer. xv. 19. "If thou take forth
the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my
mouth," Mal. iii. 18; Psal. i.; xv. (5.) Affect not
a dead and heartless way of worship, which tendeth
not to convince and waken the ungodly, nor to make
men serious as those that have to do with God.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. Let the manner of your worshipping
God be suited to the matter that you have
in hand. Remember that you are speaking either
to or of the eternal God; that you are employed
about the everlasting salvation of your own or
others' souls; that all is high and holy that you
have to do: see then that the manner be answerable
hereunto.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Offer God nothing as a part of worship
which is a lie; much less so gross a lie as to be disproved
by the common senses and reason of all the
world. God needeth not our lie unto his glory.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
What worship then do papists offer him in their
mass, who take it for an article of their faith, that
there is no bread or wine left after the consecration,
it being all transubstantiate into the very body and
blood of Christ? And when the certainty of all
men's senses is renounced, then all certainty of faith
and all religion is renounced; for all presuppose the
certainty of sense.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Worship not God in a manner that is
contrary to the true nature, and order, and operations
of a rational soul. I mean not to the corrupted
nature of man, but to nature as rational in itself considered.
As, 1. Let not your mere will and inclination
overrule your understandings; and say not as
blind lovers do, I love this, but I know not why; or
children that eat unwholesome meat, because they
love it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span>
2. Let not passion overtop your reason:
worship God with such a zeal as is according to
knowledge. 3. Let not your tongues lead your
hearts, much less overgo them: words may indeed
reflect upon the heart, and warm it more; but that
is but the secondary use: the first is to be the expressions
of the heart: you must not speak without
or against your hearts, (that is, falsely,) that by so
speaking you may better your hearts (and make
the words true, that at first were not true); unless
it be when your words are but reading recitations
or narratives, and not spoken of yourselves.
The heart was made to lead the tongue, and the
tongue to express it, and not to lead it. Therefore
speak not to God either the words of a parrot, which
you do not understand, or the words of a liar or hypocrite,
which express not the meaning, or desires,
or feeling of your hearts: but first understand and
feel what you should speak, and then speak that
which you understand and feel.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> How then can a prayer be lawful that is
read or heard from a book?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> There is in reading the eye, and in hearing
the ear, that is first to affect the heart, and then the
tongue is to perform its office. And though it be
sudden, yet the passage to the heart is first, and the
passage from the heart is last: and the soul is quick,
and can quickly thus both receive and be affected
and express itself. And the case is the same in this,
whether it be from a book, or from the words of
another without book: for the soul must do the same,
as quickly, in joining with another that speaketh
before us, without a book as with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How far the Scripture is the law or rule of
worship and discipline, and how far not.</div>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. Understand well how
far Christ hath given a law and a
rule for worship to his church in
the holy Scriptures, and so far see
that you take it as a perfect rule,
and swerve not from it by adding or diminishing.
This is a matter of great importance by reason
of the danger of erring on either side. 1. If you
think that the Scripture containeth not any law
or rule of worship at all, or not so much as indeed
it doth, you will deny a principal part of the
office of Christ, as the King and Teacher of the
church, and will accuse his laws of insufficiency, and
be tempted to worship him with a human kind of worship,
and to think yourselves at liberty to worship
him according to your own imaginations, or change
his worship according to the fashion of the age or
the country where you are. And on the other side,
if you think that the Scripture is a law and rule of
worship, more particular than Christ intended it,
you will involve yourselves and others in endless
scruples and controversies, and find fault with that
which is lawful and a duty, because you find it not
particularly in the Scripture: and therefore it is exceeding
needful to understand how far it is intended
to be herein our law and rule, and how far not: to
handle this fully would be a digression, but I shall
briefly answer it.</p>

<p>1. No doubt but Christ is the only universal Head
and Lawgiver to his church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span>
And that legislation
is the first and principal part of government: and
therefore if he had made no laws for his church, he
were not the full governor of it. And therefore he
that arrogateth this power to himself to be lawgiver
to the church universal (as such) doth usurp the
kingly office of Christ, and committeth treason
against his government; (unless he can prove that
Christ hath delegated to him this chief part of his
government, which none can do;) there being no
universal lawgiver to the church but Christ, (whether
pope or council,) no law that is made by any
mere man can be universally obligatory. Therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">{556}</a></span>
seeing the making of all universal laws doth belong
only to Christ, we may be sure that he hath perfectly
done it; and hath left nothing out of his laws that
was fit to be there, nor nothing at liberty that was
fit to be determined and commanded. Therefore
whatsoever is of equal use or consideration to the
universal church, as it is to any one part of it, and to
all times as it is to any time of the church, should
not be made a law by man to any part of the church,
if Christ have not made it a law to the whole: because
else they accuse him of being defective in his
laws, and because all his subjects are equally dependent
on him as their King and Judge. And no
man must step into his throne pretending to amend
his work which he hath done amiss, or to make up
any wants which the chief Lawgiver should have
made up.</p>

<p>2. These laws of Christ for the government of his
church, are fully contained in the holy Scriptures;
for so much as is in nature, is there also more plainly
expressed than nature hath expressed it. All is
not Christ's law that is any way expressed in Scripture;
but all Christ's laws are expressed in the Scriptures;
not written by himself, but by his Spirit in
his apostles, whom he appointed and sent to teach
all nations to observe whatever he commanded them,
Matt. xxviii. 20: who being thus commissioned and
enabled fully by the Spirit to perform it, are to be
supposed to have perfectly executed their commission;
and to have taught whatsoever Christ commanded
them, and no more as from Christ: and
therefore as they taught that present age by voice,
who could hear them, so they taught all ages after
to the end of the world by writing, because their
voice was not by them to be heard.</p>

<p>3. So far then as the Scripture is a law and rule,
it is a perfect rule; but how far it is a law or rule, its
own contents and expressions must determine. As,
(1.) It is certain that all the internal worship of God
(by love, fear, trust, desire, &amp;c.) is perfectly commanded
in the Scriptures. (2.) The doctrine of Christ which
his ministers must read and preach is perfectly contained
in the Scriptures. (3.) The grand and constantly
necessary points of order in preaching, are
there also expressed: as that the opening of men's
eyes, and the converting of them from the power of
Satan to God, be first endeavoured, and then their
confirmation and further edification, (4.) Also
that we humble ourselves before God in the confession
of our sins. (5.) And that we pray to God in
the name of Christ for mercy for ourselves and others.
(6.) That we give God thanks for his mercies to the
church, ourselves, and others. (7.) That we praise
God in his excellencies manifested in his word and
works of creation and providence. (8.) That we do
this by singing psalms with holy joyfulness of heart.
(9.) The matter and order of the ordinary prayers
and praises of christians is expressed in the Scripture
(as which parts are to have precedency in our
estimation and desire, and ordinarily in our expressions).
(10.) Christ himself hath determined that
by baptizing them into the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Ghost, men be solemnly entered
into his covenant, and church, and state of christianity.
(11.) And he hath himself appointed that his
churches hold communion with him and among
themselves, in the eucharistical administration of the
sacrament of his body and blood, represented in the
breaking, delivering, receiving, and eating the consecrated
bread, and in the pouring out, delivering, receiving,
and drinking the consecrated wine. (12.)
And as for the mutable, subservient circumstances,
and external expressions, and actions, and orders,
which were not fit to be, in particular, the matter of
a universal law, but are fit in one place, or at one
time, and not another, for these he hath left both in
nature and Scripture such general laws, by which
upon emergent occasions they may be determined;
and by particular providences he fitteth things, and
persons, and times, and places, so as that we may
discern their agreeableness to the descriptions in his
general laws: as that all things be done decently, in
order, and to edification, and in charity, unity, and
peace. And he hath forbidden generally doing any
thing undecently, disorderly, to the hurt or destruction
of our brethren, even the weak, or to the division
of the church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span>
(13.) And many things he hath
particularly forbidden in worship: as making to ourselves
any graven image, &amp;c. and worshipping angels,
&amp;c.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>And as to the order and government of the church,
(for I am willing to despatch all here together,) this
much is plainly determined in Scripture: 1. That
there be officers or ministers under Christ to be the
stated teachers of his people, and to baptize, and
administer the sacrament of his body and blood, and
be the mouth and guide of the people in public
prayers, thanksgiving, and praises, and to bind the
impenitent and loose the penitent, and to be the directors
of the flocks according to the law of God, to
life eternal; and their office is described and determined
by Christ. 2. It is required that christians
do ordinarily assemble together for God's public
worship; and be guided therein by these their pastors.
3. It is required that besides the unfixed
ministers, who employ themselves in converting infidels,
and in an itinerant service of the churches,
there be also stated, fixed ministers, having a special
charge of each particular church; and that they
may know their own flocks, and from house to house,
and the people may know their own pastors that are
over them in the Lord, and honour them and obey
them in all that they teach them from the word of
God for their salvation. 4. The ministers that baptize
are to judge of the capacity and fitness of those
whom they baptize; whether the adult that are admitted
upon their personal profession and covenanting,
or infants that are admitted upon their parents'
profession and entering them into covenant. 5. The
pastors that administer the Lord's supper to their
particular flocks, are to discern or judge of the fitness
of those persons whom they receive newly into
their charge, or whom they admit to communion in
that sacrament as members of their flock. 6. Every
such pastor is also personally to watch over all the
members of his flock as far as he is able; lest false
teachers seduce them, or Satan get advantage of
them, or any corruption or root of bitterness spring
up among them and defile them. 7. It is the duty
of the several members of the flock, if a brother
trespass against them, to tell him his faults between
them and him; and if he hear not, to take two or
three, and if he hear not them, to tell the church.
8. It is the pastor's duty to admonish the unruly, and
call them to repentance, and pray for their conversion.
9. And it is the pastor's duty to declare the
obstinately impenitent uncapable of communion with
the church, and to charge him to forbear it, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">{557}</a></span>
church to avoid him. 10. It is the people's duty to
avoid such accordingly, and have no familiarity with
them, that they may be ashamed; and with such, no,
not to eat. 11. It is the pastor's duty to absolve the
penitent, declaring the remission of their sin, and
re-admitting to the communion of the saints. 12. It
is the people's duty to re-admit the absolved to their
communion with joy, and to take them as brethren
in the Lord.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
13. Though every pastor hath a
general power to exercise his office in any part of
the church, where he shall be truly called to it; yet
every pastor hath a special obligation (and consequently
a special power) to do it over the flock, of
which he hath received the special charge and oversight.
14. The Lord's day is separated by God's
appointment for the churches' ordinary holy communion
in God's worship under the conduct of these
their guides.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span>
15. And it is requisite that the several
particular churches do maintain as much agreement
among themselves as their capacity will allow them;
and keep due synods and correspondences to that
end. Thus much of God's worship, and church
order and government, at least, is of divine institution,
and determined by Scripture, and not left to the
will or liberty of man. Thus far the form of government
(at least) is of divine right.</p>

<p>But on the contrary, 1. About doctrine and worship;
the Scripture is no law in any of these following
cases, but hath left them undetermined. (1.)
There are many natural truths which the Scripture
meddleth not with: as physics, metaphysics, logic,
&amp;c. (2.) Scripture telleth not a minister what particular
text or subject he shall preach on this day or
that. (3.) Nor what method his text or subject
shall be opened and handled in. (4.) Nor what
day of the week besides the Lord's day he shall
preach, nor what hour on the Lord's day he shall
begin. (5.) Nor in what particular place the church
shall meet. (6.) Nor what particular sins we shall
most confess; nor what personal mercies we shall
at this present time first ask; nor for what we shall
now most copiously give thanks: for special occasions
must determine all these. (7.) Nor what
particular chapter we shall now read; nor what
particular psalm we shall now sing. (8.) Nor what
particular translation of the Scripture, or version of
the Psalms, we shall now use. Nor into what sections
to distribute the Scripture, as we do by chapters and
verses. Nor whether the Bible shall be printed or
written, or in what characters, or how bound. (9.)
Nor just by what sign I shall express my consent to
the truths or duties which I am called to express
consent to (besides the sacraments and ordinary
words). (10.) Nor whether I shall use written notes
to help my memory in preaching, or preach without.
(11.) Nor whether I shall use a writing or book in
prayer, or pray without. (12.) Nor whether I shall
use the same words in preaching and prayer, or
various new expressions. (13.) Nor what utensils
in holy administration I shall use; as a temple or
an ordinary house, a pulpit, a font, a table, cups,
cushions, and many such, which belong to the
several parts of worship. (14.) Nor in what particular
gesture we shall preach, or read, or hear.
(15.) Nor what particular garments ministers or
people shall wear in time of worship. (16.) Nor
what natural or artificial helps to our natural faculties
we shall use; as medicaments for the voice,
tunes, musical instruments, spectacles, hour-glasses:
these and such like are undetermined in Scripture,
and are left to be determined by human prudence,
not as men please; but as means in order to the proper
end, according to the general laws of Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>
For Scripture is a general law for all such circumstances,
but not a particular law.</p>

<p>So also for order and government, Scripture hath
not particularly determined, 1. What individual persons
shall be the pastors of the church. 2. Or of
just how many persons the congregation shall consist.
3. Or how the pastors shall divide their work
where there are many. 4. Nor how many every
church shall have. 5. Nor what particular people
shall be a pastor's special charge. 6. Nor what
individual persons he shall baptize, receive to communion,
admonish, or absolve. 7. Nor in what
words most of these shall be expressed. 8. Nor
what number of pastors shall meet in synods, for the
communion and agreement of several churches, nor
how oft, nor at what time or place, nor what particular
order shall be among them in their consultations;
with many such like.</p>

<p>When you thus understand how far Scripture is a
law to you in the worship of God, it will be the
greatest direction to you, to keep you both from disobeying
God and your superiors; that you may
neither pretend obedience to man for your disobedience
to God, nor pretend obedience to God against
your due obedience to your governors, as those will
do that think Scripture is a more particular rule
than ever Christ intended it: and it will prevent
abundance of unnecessary scruples, contentions, and
divisions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What commands of God are not universal nor perpetual.</div>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. Observe well in Scripture
the difference between Christ's
universal laws, (which bind all his
subjects in all times and places,) and
those that are but local, personal, or alterable laws;
lest you think that you are bound to all that ever God
bound any others to. The universal laws and unalterable
are those which result from the foundation
of the universal and unalterable nature of persons
and things, and those which God hath supernaturally
revealed as suitable constantly to all. The particular,
local, or temporary laws are those, which either
resulted from a particular or alterable nature of persons
and things as mutually related, (as the law of
nature bound Adam's sons to marry their sisters,
which bindeth others against it,) or those which God
supernaturally enacted only for some particular
people or person, or for the time. If you should
mistake all the Jewish laws for universal laws, (as
to persons or duration,) into how many errors would
it lead you! So also if you mistake every personal
mandate sent by a prophet or apostle to a particular
man, as obliging all, you would make a snare of it.
Every man is not to abstain from vineyards and
wine as the Rechabites were; nor every man to go
forth to preach in the garb as Christ sent the twelve
and seventy disciples; nor every man to administer
or receive the Lord's supper in an upper room of a
house, in the evening, with eleven or twelve only,
&amp;c.; nor every one to carry Paul's cloak and parchments,
nor go up and down on the messages which
some were sent on. And here (in precepts about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">{558}</a></span>
worship) you must know what is the thing primarily
intended in the command, and what it is that is but
a subservient means; for many laws are universal
and immutable as to the matter primarily intended,
which are but local and temporary as to the matter
subservient and secondarily intended. As the command
of saluting one another with a holy kiss, and
using love-feasts in their sacred communion, primarily
intended the exercising and expressing holy love by
such convenient signs as were then in use, and suitable
to those times; but that it be done by those
particular signs, was subservient, and a local, alterable
law; as appeareth, 1. In that it is actually laid
down by God's allowance. 2. In that in other
places and times the same signs have not the same
signification and aptitude to that use at all, and
therefore would be no such expression of love; or
else have also some ill signification. So it was the
first way of baptizing to dip them over-head; which
was fit in that hot country, which in colder countries
it would not be, as being destructive to health, and
more against modesty; therefore it is plain that it
was but a local, alterable law. The same is to be
said of not eating things strangled, and blood, which
was occasioned by the offence of the Jews; and
other the like. This is the case in almost all precepts
about the external worshipping gestures: the
thing that God commandeth universally is a humble,
reverent adoration of him by the mind and body.
Now the adoration of the mind is still the same;
but the bodily expression altereth according to the
custom of countries: in most countries kneeling or
prostration are the expressions of greatest veneration
and submission: in some few countries it is more
signified by sitting with the face covered with their
hands: in some it is signified best by standing:
kneeling is ordinarily most fit, because it is the most
common sign of humble reverence; but where it is
not so, it is not fit. The same we must say of other
gestures, and of habits: the women among the
Corinthians were not to go uncovered because of the
angels, 1&nbsp;Cor. xi. 10, and yet in some places, where
long hair or covering may have a contrary signification,
the case may be contrary. The very fourth
commandment, however it was a perpetual law as to
the proportion of time, yet was alterable as to the
seventh day. Those which I call universal laws,
some call moral; but that is no term of distinction,
but signifieth the common nature of all laws, which
are for the governing of our manners. Some call
them natural laws, and the other positive: but the
truth is, there are some laws of nature which are
universal, and some that are particular, as they are
the result of universal or particular nature: and
there are some laws of nature that are perpetual,
which are the result of an unaltered foundation: and
there are some that are temporary, when it is some
temporary, alterable thing in nature from whence
the duty doth result: so there are some positive laws
that are universal or unalterable, (during this world,)
and some that are local, particular, or temporary only.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. Remember that whatever duty you
seem obliged to perform, the obligation still supposeth
that it is not naturally impossible to you, and
therefore you are bound to do it as well as you can:
and when other men's force, or your natural disability,
hindereth you from doing it as you would,
you are not therefore disobliged from doing it at all;
but the total omission is worse than the defective
performance of it, as the defective performance is
worse than the doing of it more perfectly.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span>
And in such
a case the defects which are utterly involuntary are
none of yours imputatively at all, but his that hindereth
you (unless as some other sin might cause
that). As if I were in a country where I could
have liberty to read and pray, but not to preach, or
to preach only once a month and no more; it is my
duty to do so much as I can do, as being much better
than nothing, and not to forbear all, because I
cannot do all.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But you must forbear no part of your
duty? <i>Answ.</i> True: but nothing is my duty which
is naturally impossible for me to do. Either I can
do it, or I cannot: if I can, I must (supposing it a
duty in all other respects); but if I cannot, I am not
bound to it.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But it is not suffering that must deter you,
for that is a carnal reason: and your suffering may
do more good than your preaching. <i>Answ.</i> Suffering
is considerable either as a pain to the flesh, or
as an irresistible hinderance of the work of the gospel:
as it is merely a pain to the flesh, I ought not
to be deterred by it from the work of God; but as it
forcibly hindereth me from that work, (as by imprisonment,
death, cutting out the tongue, &amp;c.) I
may lawfully foresee it, and by lawful means avoid
it, when it is sincerely for the work of Christ, and
not for the saving of the flesh. If Paul foresaw that
the preaching of one more sermon at Damascus was
like to hinder his preaching any more, because the
Jews watched the gates day and night to kill him, it
was Paul's duty to be let down by the wall in a
basket, and to escape, and preach elsewhere, Acts ix.
25. And when the christians could not safely meet
publicly, they met in secret, as John xix. 38; Acts
xii. 12, &amp;c. Whether Paul's suffering at Damascus
for preaching one more sermon, or his preaching
more elsewhere, was to be chosen, the interest of
Christ and the gospel must direct him to resolve:
that which is best for the church, is to be chosen.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Remember that no material duty is
formally a duty at all times: that which is a duty in
its season, is no duty out of season. Affirmative
precepts bind not to all times (except only to habits,
or the secret intention of our ultimate end, so far as
is sufficient to animate and actuate the means, while
we are waking and have the use of reason). Praying
and preaching, that are very great duties, may
be so unseasonably performed, as to be sins: if forbearing
a prayer, or sermon, or sacrament one day
or month, be rationally like to procure your help or
liberty to do it afterward, when that once or few
times doing it were like to hinder you from doing it
any more, it would be your duty then to forbear it
for that time (unless in some extraordinary case):
for even for the life of an ox or an ass, and for mercy
to men's bodies, the rest and holy work of a sabbath
might be interrupted; much more for the souls of
many. Again I warn you, as you must not pretend
the interest of the end against a peremptory, absolute
command of God, so must you not easily conclude
a command to be absolute and peremptory to
that which certainly contradicts the end; nor easily
take that for a duty, which certainly is no means to
that good which is the end of duty, or which is
against it. Though yet no seeming aptitude as a
means, must make that seem a duty, which the prohibition
of God hath made a sin.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XV. It is ever unseasonable to perform a
lesser duty of worship, when a greater should be
done; therefore it much concerneth you to be able
to discern, when two duties are inconsistent, which is
then the greater and to be preferred: in which the
interest of the end must much direct you; that being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">{559}</a></span>
usually the greatest which hath the greatest tendency
to the greatest good.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVI. Pretend not one part of God's worship
against another, when all, in their place and
order, may be done. Set not preaching and praying
against each other; nor public and private worship
against each other; nor internal worship against external;
but do all.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVII. Let not an inordinate respect to
man, or common custom, be too strong a bias to pervert
your judgments from the rule of worship; nor
yet any groundless prejudice make you distaste that
which is not to be disliked. The error on these two
extremes doth fill the world with corruption and
contentions about the worship of God. Among the
papists, and Russians, and other ignorant sorts of
christians, abundance of corruptions are continued
in God's worship by the mere power of custom, tradition,
and education; and all seemeth right to
which they have been long used: and hence the
churches in south, east, and west continue so long
overspread with ignorance, and refuse reformation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span>
And on the other side, mere prejudice makes some so
much distaste a prescribed form of prayer, or the
way of worship which they have not been used to,
and which they have heard some good men speak
against, whose judgments they highliest esteemed,
that they have not room for sober, impartial reason
to deliberate, try, and judge. Factions have engaged
most christians in the world into several parties,
whereby Satan hath got this great advantage, that
instead of worshipping God in love and concord,
they lay out their zeal in an envious, bitter, censorious,
uncharitable reproaching the manner of each
other's worship. And because the interest of their
parties requireth this, they think the interest of the
church and cause of God requireth it; and that they
do God service when they make the religion of other
men seem odious: whenas among most christians
in the world, the errors of their modes of worship
are not so great as the adverse parties represent
them (except only the two great crimes of the popish
worship: 1. That it is not understood, and so is
soulless. 2. They worship bread as God himself,
which I am not so able as willing to excuse from
being idolatry). Judge not in such cases by passion,
partiality, and prejudice.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVIII. Yet judge in all such controversies
with that reverence and charity which is due to the
universal and the primitive church. If you find any
thing in God's worship which the primitive or universal
church agreed in, you may be sure that it is
nothing but what is consistent with acceptable worship;
for God never rejected the worship of the
primitive or universal church. And it is not so
much as to be judged erroneous without great deliberation
and very good proof. We must be much
more suspicious of our own understandings.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIX. In circumstances and modes of worship
not forbidden in the word of God, affect not
singularity, and do not easily differ from the practice
of the church in which you hold communion, nor
from the commands or directions of your lawful governors.
It is true, if we are forbidden with Daniel
to pray, or with the apostles to speak any more in
the name of Christ, or are commanded as the three
witnesses, Dan. iii. to worship images, we must
rather obey God than man;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span>
and so in case of any
sin that is commanded us: but in case of mere different
modes, and circumstances, and order of worship,
see that you give authority and the consent of
the church where you are their due.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XX. Look more to your own hearts than
to the abilities of the ministers, or the ceremonies
or manner of the churches' worship in such lesser
things. It is heart-work and heaven-work that the
sincere believer comes about; and it is the corruption
of his heart that is the heaviest burden, which
he groaneth under with the most passionate complaints:
a hungry soul, inflamed with love to God
and man, and tenderly sensible of the excellency of
common truths and duties, would make up many
defects in the manner of public administration, and
would get nearer God in a defective, imperfect mode
of worship, than others can do with the greatest
helps;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span>
when hypocrites find so little work with their
hearts and heaven, that they are taken up about
words, and forms, and ceremonies, and external
things, applauding their own way, and condemning
other men's, and serving Satan under pretence of
worshipping God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE CHRISTIAN COVENANT WITH GOD, AND BAPTISM.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Though</span>
the first part of this book is little more than
an explication of the christian covenant with God,
yet being here to speak of baptism as a part of God's
worship, it is needful that I briefly speak also of the
covenant itself.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. It is a matter of great importance that
you well understand the nature of the christian covenant,
what it is. I shall therefore here briefly
open the nature of it, and then speak of the reasons
of it; and then of the solemnizing it by baptism, and
next of our renewing it, and lastly of our keeping it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The covenant what.</div>

<p>The christian covenant is a contract
between God and man, through
the mediation of Jesus Christ, for
the return and reconciliation of sinners unto God,
and their justification, adoption, sanctification, and
glorification by him, to his glory.</p>

<p>Here we must first consider, who are the parties
in the covenant. 2. What is the matter of the covenant
on God's part. 3. What is the matter on man's
part. 4. What are the terms of it propounded on
God's part. 5. Where and how he doth express it.
6. What are the necessary qualifications on man's
part. 7. And what are the ends and benefits of it.</p>

<p>I. The parties are God and man: God the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost on the one part, and repenting,
believing sinners on the other part. Man is the
party that needeth it; but God is the party that first
offereth it. Here note, 1. That God's part of the covenant
is made universally and conditionally with all
mankind, (as to the tenor exacted,) and so is in being
before we were born. 2. That it is not the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, considered simply as persons
in the Godhead; but as related to man for the ends
of the covenant. 3. That it is only sinners that this
covenant is made with, because the use of it is for
the restoration of those that broke a former covenant
in Adam. It is a covenant of reconciliation, and
therefore supposeth an enmity antecedent. 4. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">{560}</a></span>
I say that it is repenting and believing sinners that
are the party, I mean, (1.) That taking the covenant
in its first act, it is repentance and faith themselves
that are the act, and are our very covenanting. (2.)
But taking the covenant in its external expression,
so it is a repenting, believing sinner that must take
it, it being but the expression of his repentance and
faith, by an explicit contract with God. 5. Note,
that though God's covenant be by one universal act,
(of which more anon,) yet man's is to be made by
the several acts of the individual persons each one
for himself, and not by the acts of societies only.</p>

<p>II. The matter of the covenant on God's part
is in general, that he will be our God: more particularly,
that God the Father will be our reconciled
God and Father in Jesus Christ; that God the Son
will be our Saviour; and God the Holy Ghost will
be our Sanctifier. And the relation of a God to us
essentially containeth these three parts: 1. That
as on the title of creation and redemption he is
our Owner, so he doth take us as his own peculiar
people. 2. That as he hath title to be our absolute
King or Governor, so he doth take us as his subjects.
3. That he will be our grand Benefactor and felicity,
or our most loving Father (which compriseth all
the rest). And as he will be thus related to us, so
he will do for us all that these relations do import.
As, 1. He will do all that belongeth to a Creator for
his creature, in our preservation and supplies. 2. He
will save us from our sins, and from his wrath and
hell. 3. And he will sanctify us to a perfect conformity
to our Head. Also, 1. He will use and defend
us as his own peculiar ones. 2. He will govern us
by a law of grace and righteousness. 3. He will
make us fully happy in his love for ever.</p>

<p>III. The matter on man's part of the covenant is,
1. In respect of the <i>terminus a quo</i>, that we will
forsake the flesh, the world, and the devil, as they
are adverse to our relations and duties to God. 2. In
regard of the <i>terminus ad quem</i>, that we will take
the Lord for our God: and more particularly, 1. That
we do take God the Father for our reconciled Father
in Jesus Christ, and do give up ourselves to him as
creatures to their Maker. 2. That we do take Jesus
Christ for our Redeemer, Saviour, and Mediator, as
our High Priest, and Prophet, and King, and do
give up ourselves to him as his redeemed ones to be
reconciled to God, and saved by him. 3. That we
do take the Holy Ghost for our Regenerator and
Sanctifier, and do give up ourselves to be perfectly
renewed and sanctified by him, and by his operations
carried on to God in his holy service. Also, 1. That
we do take God for our absolute Lord or Owner,
and do give up ourselves to him as his own. 2.
That we take him for our universal, sovereign Governor,
and do give up ourselves unto him as his
subjects. 3. That we do take him for our most
bountiful Benefactor, and loving Father, and felicity,
and do give up ourselves to him as his children, to
seek him, and please him, and perfectly to love him,
delight in him, and enjoy him for ever in heaven as
our ultimate end. And in consenting to these relations,
we covenant to do the duties of them in sincerity.</p>

<p>IV. The terms or conditions which God requireth
of man in his covenant are, consent, and fidelity or
performance: he first consenteth conditionally, if
we will consent; and he consenteth to be actually
our God, when we consent to be his people: so that
as bare consent, without any performance, doth found
the relation between husband and wife, master and
servant, prince and people; but the sincere performance
of the duties of the relation which we consent
to, are needful afterward to continue the relation,
and attain the benefits and ends; so is it also between
God and man. We are his children in covenant as
soon as we consent; but we shall not be glorified but
on condition of sincere performance and obedience.</p>

<p>V. God's covenant with man is nothing else but
the universal promise in the gospel; and (to the
solemnization) the declaration, and application, and
solemn investiture or delivery by his authorized
ministers. 1. The gospel, as it relateth the matters
of fact in and about the work of our redemption, is
a sacred history. 2. As it containeth the terms on
which God will be served, and commandeth us to
obey them for our salvation, it is called the law of
Christ or grace. 3. As it containeth the promise of
life and salvation conditionally offered, it is called
God's promise, and covenant (viz. on his part, as it
is proposed only). 4. When by our consent the
condition is so far performed, or the covenant accepted,
then God's conditional, universal promise or
covenant, becometh actual and particular as to the
effect; and so the covenant becometh mutual between
God and man: as if a king make an act or
law of pardon and oblivion to a nation of rebels,
saying, Whoever cometh in by such a day, and confesseth
his fault, and sueth out his pardon, and promiseth
fidelity for the future, shall be pardoned.
This act is a law in one respect, and it is a universal,
conditional pardon of all those rebels; or a promise
of pardon; and an offer of pardon to all that
it is revealed to: but it is an actual pardon to those
that come in, and conferreth on them the benefits of
the act as if they were named in it, and is their very
title to their pardon, of which their consent is the
condition; and the condition being performed, the
pardon or collation of the benefit becometh particular
and actual, without any new act; it being the sense
of the law itself, or conditional grant, that so it
should do. So as to the reality of the internal covenant
interest and benefits, justification and adoption,
it is ours by virtue of this universal conditional covenant,
when we perform the condition. But as to
our title <i>in foro ecclesiæ</i>, and the due solemnization
and investiture, it is made ours when God's minister
applieth it to us in baptism by his commission; as
the rebel that was fundamentally pardoned by the
act of oblivion, must yet have his personal pardon
delivered him by the lord chancellor under the
great seal. In this sense ministers are the instruments
of God, not only in declaring us to be pardoned,
but in delivering to us the pardon of our
sins, and solemnly investing us therein: as an attorney
delivereth possession to one that before had
his fundamental title. Thus God entereth into covenant
with man.</p>

<p>VI. The qualifications of absolute necessity to the
validity of our covenant with God <i>in foro interiori</i>,
are these: 1. That we understand what we do as to
all the essentials of the covenant; for <i>ignorantis non
est consensus</i>. 2. That it be our own act, performed
by our natural or legal selves, that is, some one
that hath power so far to dispose of us (as parents
have of their children). 3. That it be deliberate,
sober, and rational, done by one that is <i>compos mentis</i>,
in his wits, and not in drunkenness, madness, or incogitancy.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span>
4. That it be seriously done with a real
intention of doing the thing, and not histrionically,
ludicrously, or in jest. 5. That it be done entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">{561}</a></span>
as to all essential parts; for if we leave out any
essential part of the covenant, it is no sufficient consent
(as to consent that Christ shall be our Justifier,
but not the Holy Ghost our Sanctifier). 6. That it
be a present consent to be presently in covenant with
God: for to consent that you will be his servants to-morrow
or hereafter, but not yet, is but to purpose
to be in covenant with him hereafter, and is no present
covenanting with him. 7. Lastly, it must be a resolved
and absolute consent, without any open or
secret exceptions or reserves.</p>

<p>VII. The fruits of the covenant which God reapeth,
(though he need nothing,) is the pleasing of his
good and gracious will, in the exercise of his love
and mercy, and the praise and glory of his grace, in
his people's love and happiness for ever. The fruits
or benefits which accrue to man are unspeakable, and
would require a volume competently to open them:
especially that God is our God, and Christ our Saviour,
Head, Intercessor, and Teacher, and the Holy Ghost
is our Sanctifier; and that God will regard us as his
own, and will protect us, preserve us, and provide
for us, and will govern us, and be our God and joy
for ever; that he will pardon us, justify, and adopt
us, and glorify us with his Son in heaven.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. When you thus understand well the
nature of the covenant, labour to understand the special
reasons of it. The reasons of the matter of the
covenant you may see in the fruits and benefits now
mentioned. But I now speak of the reason of it as a
covenant <i>in genere</i>, and such a covenant <i>in specie</i>.</p>

<p>1. In general, God will have man to receive life or
death as an accepter and keeper, or a refuser or
breaker, of his covenant, because he will do it not
only as a Benefactor, or absolute Lord, but also as a
Governor, and will make his covenant to be also his
law, and his promise and benefits to promote obedience;
and because he will deal with man as with a
free agent, and not as with a brute that hath no
choosing and refusing power, conducted by reason:
man's life and death shall be in his own hands, and
still depend upon his own will; though God will secure
his own dominion, interest, and ends, and put
nothing out of his own power by putting it into
man's; nor have ever the less his own will, by leaving
man to his own will. God will at last, as a righteous
Judge, determine all the world to their final joy
or punishment, according to their own choice while
they were in the flesh, and according to what they
have done in the body, whether it be good or evil,
Matt. xxv. Therefore he will deal with us on covenant
terms.</p>

<p>2. And he hath chosen to rule and judge men according
to a covenant of grace, by a Redeemer, and
not according to a rigorous law of works, that his goodness
and mercy may be the fullier manifested to the
sons of men; and that it may be easier for men to
love him, when they have so wonderful demonstrations
of his love; and so that their service here, and
their work and happiness hereafter, may consist of
love, to the glory of his goodness, and the pleasure
of his love for ever.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Next understand rightly the nature,
use, and end of baptism. Baptism is to the mutual
covenant between God and man, what the solemnization
of marriage is to them that do before consent;
or what the listing a soldier by giving him
colours, and writing his name, is to one that consented
before to be a soldier.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span>
In my "Universal Concord," p. 29, 30, I have thus described it: <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>External baptism, what.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>Baptism is a holy sacrament instituted
by Christ, in which a person professing the christian faith (or
the infant of such) is baptized in water into the
name of the Father, the Son, and Holy Ghost, in
signification and solemnization of the holy covenant,
in which as a penitent believer (or the seed of such)
he giveth up himself (or is by the parent given up)
to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, forsaking the
devil, the world, and the flesh, and is solemnly entered
a visible member of Christ and his church, a pardoned,
regenerate child of God, and an heir of heaven.</p>

<p>As the word baptism is taken for the mere administration
or external ordinance, so the internal
covenanting or faith and repentance of the (adult)
person to be baptized, is no essential part of it, nor
requisite to the being of it; but only the profession
of such a faith and repentance, and the external
entering of the covenant; but as baptism is taken
for the ordinance as performed in all its essential
parts, according to the true intent of Christ in his
institution (that is, in the first and proper meaning
of the word); so the internal covenanting of a penitent,
sincere believer, is necessary to the being of it.
And indeed the word baptism is taken but equivocally
or analogically at most, when it is taken for
the mere external administration and action: for God
doth not institute worship ordinances for bodily motion
only; when he speaketh to man, and requireth
worship of man, he speaketh to him as to a man,
and requireth human actions from him, even the
work of the soul, and not the words of a parrot, or
the motion of a puppet. Therefore the word baptism
in the first and proper signification, doth take
in the inward actions of the heart, as well as the
outward professions and actions. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Complete baptism, what it is.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>And
in this proper sense baptism is the mutual covenant between God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and a penitent believing
sinner, solemnized by the washing of water, in which
as a sacrament of his own appointment God doth engage
himself to be the God and reconciled Father, the
Saviour and the Sanctifier, of the believer, and taketh
him for his reconciled child in Christ, and delivereth
to him, by solemn investiture, the pardon of all his
sins, and title to the mercies of this life and of that
which is to come. What I say in this description
of a penitent believer, is also to be understood of the
children of such that are dedicated by them in baptism
to God, who thereupon have their portion in
the same covenant of grace.</p>

<p>The word baptism is taken in the first sense when
Simon Magus is said to be baptized, Acts xxviii.
And when we speak of it only in the ecclesiastic
sense, as it is true baptism <i>in foro ecclesiæ</i>; but it is
taken in the latter sense when it is spoken of as the
complete ordinance of God, in the sense of the institution,
and as respecting the proper ends of baptism,
as pardon of sin and life eternal; and <i>in foro cœli</i>.</p>

<p>In this full and proper sense it is taken by Christ
when he saith, Mark xvi. 16, "He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved;" that is, he that believeth,
and is by baptism entered into the covenant
of God; and in this sense the ancients took it, when
they affirmed that all that were baptized were regenerated,
pardoned, and made the children of God.
And in this sense it is most true, that he that is baptized
(that is, is a sincere covenanter) shall be saved
if he die in that condition that he is then in.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span>
All that the minister warrantably baptizeth, are sacramentally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">{562}</a></span>
regenerate, and are <i>in foro ecclesiæ</i> members
of Christ, and children of God, and heirs of heaven:
but it is only those that are sincerely delivered up
in covenant to God in Christ, that are spiritually and
really regenerate, and are such as shall be owned for
members of Christ and children of God <i>in foro cœli</i>.
Therefore it is not unfit that the minister call the
baptized, regenerate and pardoned members of Christ,
and children of God, and heirs of heaven, supposing
that <i>in foro ecclesiæ</i> they were the due subjects of baptism.
But if the persons be such as ought not to be
baptized, the sin then is not in calling baptized persons
regenerate, but in baptizing those that ought not
to have been baptized, and to whom the seal of the
covenant was not due.</p>

<p>None ought to be baptized but those that either
personally deliver up themselves in covenant to God
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, professing a true
repentance, and faith, and consent to the covenant;
or else are thus delivered up, and dedicated, and
entered into covenant in their infancy, by those that,
being christians themselves, have so much interest
in them and power of them, that their act may be
esteemed as the infants' act, and legally imputed to
them as if themselves had done it. If any others are
unduly baptized, they have hereby no title to the
pardon of sin or life eternal, nor are they taken by
God to be in covenant, as having no way consented
to it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. When you enter a child into the christian
covenant with God, address yourselves to it as
to one of the greatest works in the world; as those
that know the greatness of the benefit, of the duty,
and of the danger. The benefit to them that are
sincere in the covenant, is no less than to have the
pardon of all our sins, and to have God himself to be
our God and Father, and Christ our Saviour, and the
Holy Ghost our Sanctifier, and to have title to the
blessings of this life and of that to come. And for
the duty, how great a work it is for a sinner to enter
into so solemn a covenant with the God of heaven,
for reconciliation and newness of life, and for salvation!
And therefore if any should abuse God by
hypocrisy, and take on them to consent to the terms
of the covenant, (for themselves, or their children,)
when indeed they do not, the danger of such profaneness
and abuse of God must needs be great. Do it
therefore with that due preparation, reverence, and
seriousness, as beseemeth those that are transacting
a business of such unspeakable importance with God
Almighty.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Having been entered in your infancy
into the covenant of God by your parents, you must,
at years of discretion, review the covenant which by
them you made, and renew it personally yourselves;
and this with as great seriousness and resolution as
if you were now first to enter and subscribe it, and
as if your everlasting life or death were to depend
on the sincerity of your consent and performance.
For your infant baptismal covenanting will save none
of you that live to years of discretion, and do not as
heartily own it in their own persons, as if they had
been now to be baptized. But this I pass by,
having said so much of it in my "Book of Confirmation."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of renewing the covenant oft.</div>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Your covenant thus,
1. Made; 2. Solemnized by baptism;
3. And owned at age; must, 4. Be
frequently renewed through the whole course of
your lives. As, (1.) Your first consent must be
habitually continued all your days; for if that ceaseth,
your grace and title to the benefits of God's
covenant ceaseth. (2.) This covenant is virtually
renewed in every act of worship to God; for you
speak to him as your God in covenant, and offer yourselves
to him as his covenanted people. (3.) This
covenant should be actually renewed frequently in
prayer and meditation, and other such acts of communion
with God. (4.) Especially when after a fall
we beg the pardon of our sins, and the mercies of the
covenant, and on days of humiliation and thanksgiving,
and in great distresses, or exhilarating mercies.
(5.) And the Lord's supper is an ordinance instituted
to this very end. It is no small part of our christian
diligence and watchfulness, to keep up and renew our
covenant consent.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. And as careful must you be to keep or
perform your covenant, as to enter it, and renew it;
which is done, 1. By continuing our consent; 2. By
sincere obedience; 3. And by perseverance. We do
not (nor dare not) promise to obey perfectly, nor
promise to be as obedient as the higher and better
sort of christians, though we desire both; but to obey
sincerely we must needs promise, because we must
needs perform it.</p>

<p>Obedience is sincere, 1. When the radical consent
or subjection of the heart to God in Christ is habitually
and heartily continued. 2. When God's
interest in us is most predominant, and his authority
and law can do more with us, than any fleshly lust
or worldly interest, or than the authority, word, or
persuasions of any man whosoever. 3. When we
unfeignedly desire to be perfect, and habitually and
ordinarily have a predominant love to all that is
good, and a hatred to that which is evil; and had
rather do our duty than be excused from it, and
rather be saved from our sin than keep it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. While you sincerely consent unto
the covenant, live by faith upon the promised benefits
of it, believing that God will make good on his
part all that he hath promised. Take it for your
title to pardon, sonship, and eternal life. O think
what a mercy it is to have God in covenant with you
to be your God, your Father, Saviour, Sanctifier,
and felicity! And in this continually rejoice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS ABOUT THE PROFESSION OF OUR RELIGION
TO OTHERS.</span></h2>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Understand first how great a duty the
profession of true religion is, that you may not think
as some foolish people, that every man should conceal
his religion, or keep it to himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span>
Observe
therefore these reasons following which require it.</p>

<p>1. Our tongues and bodies are made to exercise
and show forth that acknowledgment and adoration
of God which is in our hearts. And as he denieth
God with the heart who doth not believe in him and
worship him in his heart, so he denieth God imputatively
with his tongue and life, who doth not profess
and honour him with his tongue and life; and
so he is a practical atheist. Isa. xlv. 23-25, "I
have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my
mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That
unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall
swear. Surely shall one say, In the Lord have I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">{563}</a></span>
righteousness and strength&mdash;In the Lord shall all the
seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory." So Phil.
ii. 9-11, "Wherefore God also hath highly exalted
him, and given him a name above every name, that
at the name of Jesus every knee should bow&mdash;and
that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." Isa.
xliv. 5, "One shall say, I am the Lord's; and
another shall call him by the name of Jacob; and
another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord,
and surname himself by the name of Israel."</p>

<p>2. The public assemblies, and worship of God, are
purposely appointed by him, that in them we might
make open profession of our religion. He that denieth
profession, denieth the public faith and worship
of the church, and denieth baptism and the
Lord's supper, which are sacraments appointed for
the solemn profession of our faith.</p>

<p>3. Our profession is needful to our glorifying God.
Men see not our hearts, nor know whether we believe
in God or not, nor what we believe of him, till
they hear or see it in our profession and actions.
Paul's life and death was a profession of Christ, that
in his "boldness Christ might be magnified in his
body," Phil. i. 20. Matt. v. 14-16, "Ye are the
light of the world: a city that is set on a hill cannot
be hid. Neither do men light a candle to put
it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth
light to all that are in the house. Let your light so
shine before men, that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."</p>

<p>4. Our profession is the means of saving others:
that which is secret, is no means to profit them.
They must see our good works that they may glorify
God, Phil. i. 12-14.</p>

<p>5. God hath required our open and bold profession
of him, with the strictest commands, and
upon the greatest penalties. 1&nbsp;Pet. v. 3, "Sanctify
the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always
to give an answer to every man that asketh you a
reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and
fear." Rom. x. 9, 10, "If thou shalt confess with
thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy
heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou
shalt be saved: for with the heart man believeth
unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession
is made unto salvation." Mark viii. 38, "Whosoever
shall be ashamed of me and of my words, in this
adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall
the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the
glory of his Father with the holy angels."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Next, understand what it is in religion
that you must principally profess.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span>
It is not every
lesser truth, much less every opinion of your own,
in which you are confident that you are wiser than
your brethren. This is the meaning of Rom. xiv.
22, "Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before
God." By "faith" here is not meant the substance
of the christian belief, or any one necessary article
of it. But a belief of the indifferency of such things
as Paul spake of, in meats and drinks. If thou know
these things to be lawful when thy weak brother
doth not, and so thou be wiser than he, thank God
for thy knowledge, and use it to thy own salvation;
but do not proudly and uncharitably contend for it,
and use it uncharitably to the danger of another's
soul, much less to the wrong of the church and gospel,
and the hinderance of greater truths. 2&nbsp;Tim. ii.
14, "Of these things put them in remembrance,"
(that is, of the saints' hope in God's faithfulness,)
"charging them before the Lord that they strive not
about words to no profit, but the subverting of the
hearers." Yet "for the faith we must earnestly
contend," Jude 2, 3. 2&nbsp;Tim. ii. 23, 24, "But foolish
and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do
gender strife. And the servant of the Lord must not
strive, but be gentle to all men."</p>

<p>But that which is the chiefest matter of our profession
is, The being and perfections of God himself;
his love to man, and power over him, and
man's subjection and obligations unto God; the person,
and office, and works, and benefits of our Redeemer,
with all the duty that we owe to him in
perfect holiness, and all the hopes that we have in
him; the happiness of the saints, the odiousness of
sin, and the misery of the wicked. These, and such
as these, are things that we are called to profess; yet
so as not to deny or renounce the smallest truth.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Understand also the manner how we
must make profession of religion. 1. There is a
professing by words, and a professing by actions.
2. There is a solemn profession by God's public ordinances,
and an occasional or privater profession
by conference, or by our conversations. And all
these ways must religion be professed.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Understand also the season of each
sort of profession, that you omit not the season, nor
do it unseasonably. 1. Profession by baptism,
Lord's supper, and church assemblies, must be done
in their season, which the church guides are the
conductors of. 2. Profession by an innocent, blameless,
obedient life is never out of season. 3. Profession
by private conference, and by occasional acts
of piety, must be when opportunity inviteth us, and
they are likely to attain their ends. 4. The whole
frame of a believer's life should be so holy, and heavenly,
and mortified, and above the world, as may
amount to a serious profession that he liveth in confident
hope of the life to come, and may show the
world the difference between a worldling and an
heir of heaven; between corrupted nature and true
grace. The professors of godliness must be a peculiar
people, zealous of good works, and adorned with
them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Take special care that your profession
be sincere, and that you be yourselves as good as
you profess to be. Otherwise, 1. Your profession
will condemn yourselves. 2. And it will dishonour
the truth which you deceitfully profess. There can
scarce a greater injury befall a good cause, than to
have a bad and shameful patron to defend it. Rom.
ii. 3, "And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest
them which do such things, and dost the same, that
thou shalt escape the judgment of God." Verse
23-25, "Thou that makest thy boast of the law,
through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?
For the name of God is blasphemed among the gentiles
through you&mdash;."</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Let not your profession be so much of
your own sincerity as of God and his excellencies:
boast not of yourselves, but of God and Christ, and
the promise, and the hope of true believers; and do
it to God's praise, and not for your own. Be sure
that in all your profession of religion, you be seeking
honour to God, and not unto yourselves. And
then in this manner he that doubteth of his own sincerity,
yet may and must make profession of Christ
and true religion; when you cannot proclaim the
uprightness of your own hearts, you may boldly proclaim
the excellencies of religion, and the happiness
of saints.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Live upon God alone, and trust his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">{564}</a></span>
all-sufficiency, and abhor that pusillanimity and
baseness of spirit which maketh men afraid or
ashamed openly to own the truth. Remember the
example of your Lord, who before Pontius Pilate
"witnessed a good confession," 1&nbsp;Tim. vi. 13; who
came "for this end into the world, to bear witness
to the truth," John xviii. 37. Fear not the face of
man, whose breath is in his nostrils, and is perishing
even while he is threatening.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span>
If thou believe
not that Christ can secure thee from the rage of man,
thou believest not indeed in Christ. If thou believe
not that heaven will satisfy for all that by scorns or
cruelties thou sufferest from sinners, thou hast not
indeed the hope of a believer. And no wonder if
thou profess not that which thou believest not. But
if thou believe that God is God, and Christ is Christ,
and heaven is heaven, and the gospel is true, thou
hast enough in thy belief to secure thee against all
the scorns and cruelties of man, and to tell thee that
Christ will bear thy charges, in all that thou sufferest
for his sake. Oh what abundance are secretly convinced
of the truth, and their consciences bear witness
to the wisdom of the saints, and a holy life;
and yet they dare not openly own and stand to the
truth which they are convinced of for fear of being
mocked by the tongues of the profane, or for fear of
losing their places and preferments! O wretch, dost
thou not tremble when thou art ashamed of Christ,
to think of the day when he will be ashamed of thee?
Then when he comes in glory none will be ashamed
of him! Then where is the tongue that mocked him
and his servants? Who then will deride his holy
ways? Then that will be the greatest glory, which
thou art now ashamed of. Canst thou believe that
day, and yet hide thy profession, through cowardly
fear or shame of man? Is man so great, and is
Christ no greater in thine eyes than so? If he be
not more regardable than man, believe not in him:
if he be, regard him more; and let not a worm be
preferred before thy Saviour.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. If any doubt arise, whether thou
shouldest now make particular profession of the truth,
(as in the presence of scorners, or when required by
magistrates or others, &amp;c.) let not the advice or interest
of the flesh have any hand at all in the resolving of
the case; but let it be wholly determined as the interest
of Christ requireth. Spare thyself when the
interest of Christ requireth it; not for thyself, but
for him. But when his interest is most promoted by
thy suffering, rejoice that thou art any way capable
of serving him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Though sometimes a particular profession
of the faith may be unseasonable, yet you
must never make any profession of the contrary,
either by words or actions. Truth may be sometimes
silenced, but a lie may never be professed or approved.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. If any that profess christianity reproach
you for the profession of holiness and diligence, convince
them that they hypocritically profess the same,
and that holiness is essential to christianity: open
their baptismal covenant to them, and the Lord's
prayer, in which they daily pray that God's will may
be done on earth even as it is in heaven, which is more
strictly than the best of us can reach. The difference
between them and you is but this, whether we should
be christians hypocritically in jest, or in good earnest.</p>

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS ABOUT VOWS AND PARTICULAR COVENANTS WITH GOD.</span></h2>

<h3><i>Tit. 1. Directions for the Right Making such Vows
and Covenants.</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">What a vow is.</div>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Understand the nature
of a vow, and the use to which it is
appointed.</p>

<p>A vow is a promise made to God. 1. It is not a
bare assertion or negation. 2. It is not a mere pollicitation,
or expression of the purpose or resolution
of the mind: for he that saith or meaneth no more
than, I am purposed or resolved to do this, may upon
sufficient reason do the contrary; for he may change
his mind and resolution, without any untruth or injury
to any. 3. It is not a mere devoting of a thing
to God for the present by actual resignation. For
the present actual delivery of a thing to sacred uses
is no promise for the future: though we usually join
them both together, yet <i>devovere</i> may be separated
from <i>vovere</i>. 4. It must be therefore a promise,
which is, a voluntary obliging ones self to another
<i>de futuro</i> for some good. 5. It is therefore implied
that it be the act of a rational creature, and of one
that in that act hath some competent use of reason,
and not of a fool, or idiot, or mad-man, or a child that
hath not reason for such an act, no nor of a brain-sick
or melancholy person, who (though he be
<i>cætera sanus</i>) is either delirant in that business, or is
irresistibly borne down and necessitated by his disease
to vow against the sober, deliberate conclusion
of his reason at other times, having at the time of
vowing, reason enough to strive against the act, but
not self-government enough to restrain a passionate,
melancholy vow. 6. Whereas some casuists make
deliberation necessary, it must be understood that to
the being of a vow so much deliberation is requisite
as may make it a rational human act, it must be an
act of reason; but for any further deliberation, it is
necessary only to the well-being, and not to the being
of a vow, and without it it is a rash vow, but not
no vow.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span>
7. When we say, it must be a voluntary
act, the meaning is not that it must be totally and
absolutely voluntary, without any fear or threatening
to induce us to it; but only that it be really voluntary,
that is, an act of choice, by a free agent, that
considering all things doth choose so to do. He
that hath a sword set to his breast, and doth swear
or vow to save his life, doth do it voluntarily, as
choosing rather to do it than to die. Man having
free-will, may choose rather to die, than vow, if he
think best: his will may be moved by fear, but cannot
be forced by any one, or any means whatsoever.
8. When I say that a vow is a promise, I imply that
the matter of it is necessarily some real or supposed
good; to be good, or to do good, or not to do evil.
Evil may be the matter of an oath, but it is not properly
a vow, if the matter be not supposed good.
9. It is a promise made to God, that we are now
speaking of; whether the name of a vow belong to
a promise made only to man, is a question <i>de nomine</i>,
which we need not stop at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">{565}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The sorts of vows.</div>

<p>A vow is either a simple promise
to God, or a promise bound with an
oath or imprecation. Some would appropriate the
name of a vow to this last sort only, (when men
swear they will do this or that,) which indeed is the
most formidable sort of vowing; but the true nature
of a vow is found also in a simple self-obliging
promise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The use of vows.</div>

<p>The true reason and use of vows
is but for the more certain and effectual
performance of our duties: not to make new
laws, and duties, and religions for us, but to drive on
the backward, lingering soul to do its duty, and to
break over difficulties and delays: that by strengthening
our bonds, and setting the danger before our
eyes, we may be excited to escape it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The obligation of vows.</div>

<p>It is a great question, whether our
own vows can add any new obligation
to that which before lay upon us
from the command of God. Amesius saith, (Cas.
Consc. lib. iv. c. 16.) <i>Non additur proprie in istis
nova obligatio, neque augetur in se prior: sed magis
agnoscitur et recipitur a nobis: passive in istis æque
fuimus antea obligati: sed activa recognitione arctius
nobis applicatur a nobismetipsis.</i> Others commonly
speak of an additional obligation; and indeed there
is a double obligation added by a vow, to that which
God before had laid on us, to the matter of that
vow. Premising this distinction between <i>obligatio
imponentis</i>, a governing obligation, (which is the
effect of governing right or authority,) and <i>obligatio
consentientis</i>, a self-obliging by voluntary consent,
(which is the effect of that dominion which a rational
free agent hath over his own actions,) I say, 1. He
that voweth doth oblige himself, who before was
obliged by God only; and that a man hath a power
to oblige himself, is discerned by the light of nature,
and is the ground of the law of nations, and of
human converse: and though this is no divine obligation,
yet it is not therefore none at all. 2. But
moreover he that voweth doth induce upon himself
a new divine obligation, by making himself the subject
of it. For example; God hath said, "Honour
the Lord with thy substance:" this command obligeth
me to obey it whether I vow it or not. The same
God hath said, "Pay thy vows to the Most High,"
Psal. l. 14; and, "When thou vowest a vow to God,
defer not to pay it," Eccles. v. 4. This layeth no
obligation on me till I vow; but when I have vowed
it doth: so that now I am under a double divine
obligation, (one to the matter of the duty, and another
to keep my vow,) and under a self-obligation of my
own vow: whence also a greater penalty will be due
if I now offend, than else would have been.</p>

<p>Hence you may see what to think of the common
determination of casuists concerning vows materially
sinful, when they say, a man is not obliged to keep
them. It is only thus far true, that God obligeth
him not to do that particular thing which he voweth,
for God had before forbidden it, and he changeth
not his laws upon man's rash vowings; but yet
there is a self-obligation which he laid upon himself
to do it: and this self-obligation to a sinful act,
was itself a sin, and to be repented of, and not performed;
but it bringeth the person under a double
obligation to penalty, as a perjured person, even
God's obligation who bindeth the perjured to penalty,
and the obligation of his own consent to the punishment,
if there was any oath or imprecation in the
vow. If it were true that such a person had brought
himself under no obligation at all, then he could not
be properly called perjured, nor punished as perjured;
but he that sweareth and voweth to do evil,
(as the Jews to kill Paul,) though he ought not to do
the thing, (because God forbiddeth it,) yet he is a
perjured person for breaking his vow, and deserveth
the penalty, not only of a rash vower, but of one
perjured. Thus error may make a man sinful and
miserable, though it cannot warrant him to sin.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Try well the matter of your vows, and
venture not on them till you are sure that they are
not things forbidden: things sinful or doubtful are
not fit matter for a vow: in asserting, subscribing,
and witnessing, you should take care, that you know
assuredly that the matter be true, and venture not
upon that which may prove false; much more should
you take care that you venture not doubtingly in
vows and oaths. They are matters to be handled
with dread and tenderness, and not to be played with,
and rashly ventured on, as if it were but the speaking
of a common word: "Be not rash with thy mouth,
and let not thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before
God," Eccles. v. 2. It is a grievous snare that
men are oft brought into by ignorant and rash vows;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span>
as the case of Jephthah, and Herod, and many another
tell us for our warning: an error in such cases is
much more safely and cheaply discerned before,
than afterwards. To have a rash vow or perjury
to repent of, is to set a bone in joint, or pull a
thorn out of your very eye; and who would choose
such pain and smart? "Suffer not thy mouth to
cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the
angel that it was an error: wherefore should God
be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy
hands," Eccles. v. 6. "It is a snare to the man who
devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make
inquiry," Prov. xx. 25. Be careful and deliberate to
prevent such snares.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Vow not in a passion: stay till the
storm be over: whether it be anger or desire, or
whatever the passion be, delay and deliberate before
you vow; for when passion is up, the judgment is
upon great disadvantage. In your passion you are
apt to be most peremptory and confident when you
are most deceived: if it be your duty to vow, it will
be your duty to-morrow when you are calm. If you
say, that duty must not be delayed, and that you
must do it while the Spirit moveth you: I answer,
Was it not as much a duty before your passion was
kindled as now? It is no sinful delaying of so great
a duty, to stay till you have well proved whether it
be of God. If it be the Spirit of Christ that moveth
you to it, he will be willing that you deliberate and
try it by that word which the same Spirit hath indited
to be your rule. God's Spirit worketh principally
upon the judgment and the will, by settled
convictions, which will endure a rational trial: it is
liker to be your own spirit which worketh principally
on the passion, and will not endure the
trial, nor come into the light, John iii. 18, 19; Isa.
viii. 20.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Make not a vow of things indifferent
and unnecessary: if they be not good, in a true, comparing,
practical judgment, which considereth all
accidents and circumstances, they are no fit matter
for a vow. Some say, things indifferent are the
fittest matter both for vows and human laws; but
either they speak improperly or untruly, and therefore
dangerously at the best. If an idle word be a
sin, then an idle action is not a thing to be vowed,
because it is not a thing to be done, being as truly a
sin as an idle word: and that which is wholly indifferent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">{566}</a></span>
is idle; for if it be good for any thing, it is
not wholly indifferent; and because it is antecedently
useless, it is consequently sinful to be done.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> I. But those that say things indifferent may
be vowed, mean not, things useless or unprofitable
to any good end; but only those things that are good
and useful, but not commanded: such as are the
matter of God's counsels, and tend to man's perfection,
as to vow chastity, poverty, and absolute obedience.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> There are no such things as are morally
good, and not commanded: this is the fiction of men
that have a mind to accuse God's laws and government
of imperfection, and think sinful man can do
better than he is commanded, when none but Christ
ever did so well.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> I. What is moral goodness in any creature
and subject, but a conformity to his ruler's will expressed
in his law? And if this conformity be its
very form and being, it cannot be that any thing
should be morally good that is not commanded.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> II. Doth not the law of God command us
to love him with all our heart, and soul, and strength,
and accordingly to serve him? And is it possible to
give him more than all; or can God come after and
counsel us to give him more than is possible?</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> III. Doth not the law of nature oblige us
to serve God to the utmost of our power? He that
denieth it, is become unnatural, and must deny God
to be God, or deny himself to be his rational creature:
for nothing is more clear in nature, than that
the creature who is nothing, and hath nothing but
from God, and is absolutely his own, doth owe him
all that he is able to do.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> IV. Doth not Christ determine the case to
his disciples, Luke xvii. 10?</p>

<p>A middle between good and evil in morality is a
contradiction: there is no such thing; for good and
evil are the whole of morality: without these species
there is no morality.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> II. It seems then you hold that there is
nothing indifferent, which is a paradox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether any things be indifferent?</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> No such matter: there are
thousands and millions of things that
are indifferent; but they are things
natural only, and not things moral. They are indifferent
as to moral good and evil, because they are
neither; but they are not <i>indifferentia moralia</i>: the
indifferency is a negation of any morality in them
<i>in genere</i>, as well as of both the species of morality.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span>
Whatsoever participateth not of virtue or vice, and
is not eligible or refusable by a moral agent as such,
hath no morality in it. There may be two words so
equal as it may be indifferent which you speak; and
two eggs so equal, as that it may be indifferent
which you eat; but that is no more than to say, the
choosing of one before the other is not <i>actus moralis</i>:
there is no matter of morality in the choice.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> III. But if there may be things natural
that are indifferent, why not things moral?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> As goodness is convertible with entity, there
is no natural being but is good: as goodness signifieth
commodity, there is nothing but is profitable
or hurtful, and that is good to one that is hurtful to
another: but if it were not so, yet such goodness or
badness is but accidental to natural being; but moral
goodness and badness is the whole essence of morality.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> IV. But doth not the apostle say, "He
that marrieth doth well, and he that marrieth not
doth better?" Therefore all is not sin which is
not best.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether marrying be indifferent?</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The question put to the
apostle to decide, was about marrying
or not marrying, as it belonged to all
christians in general, and not as it belonged to this
or that individual person by some special reason differently
from others. And so in respect to the
church in general, the apostle determineth that there
is no law binding them to marry, or not to marry:
for a law that is made for many must be suited
to what is common to those many. Now marriage
being good for one and not for another, is not made
the matter of a common law, nor is it fit to be so,
and so far is left indifferent: but because that to
most it was rather a hinderance to good in those
times of the church, than a help, therefore for the
present necessity, the apostle calleth marrying "doing
well," because it was not against any universal
law, and it was a state that was suitable to some;
but he calls not marrying "doing better," because
it was then more ordinarily suited to the ends of
christianity. Now God maketh not a distinct law
for every individual person in the church; but one
universal law for all: and this being a thing variable
according to the various cases of individual persons,
was unfit to be particularly determined by a universal
law. But if the question had been only of
any one individual person, then the decision would
have been thus: though marrying is a thing not
directly commanded or forbidden, yet to some it is
helpful as to moral ends, to some it is hurtful, and
to some it is so equal or indifferent, that it is neither
discernibly helpful nor hurtful; now by the general
laws or rules of Scripture to them that <i>consideratis
considerandis</i> it is discernibly helpful, it is not indifferent,
but a duty; to them that it is discernibly
hurtful, it is not indifferent, but a sin; to them that
it is neither discernibly helpful or hurtful as to
moral ends, it is indifferent, as being neither duty nor
sin; for it is not a thing of moral choice or nature at all.
But the light of nature telleth us that God hath not
left it indifferent to men to hinder themselves or to
help themselves as to moral ends; else why pray we,
"Lead us not into temptation?" And marriage is
so great a help to some, and so great a hurt to others,
that no man can say that it is morally indifferent to
all men in the world: and therefore that being none
of the apostle's meaning, it followeth that his meaning
is as aforesaid.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> V. But there are many things indifferent
in themselves, though not as clothed with all their
accidents and circumstances: and these actions being
good in their accidents, may be the matter of a vow.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> True, but those actions are commanded
duties, and not things indifferent as so circumstantiated.
It is very few actions in the world that are
made simply duties or sins, in their simple nature
without their circumstances and accidents: the commonest
matter of all God's laws, is actions or dispositions
which are good or evil in their circumstances
and accidents. Therefore I conclude, things wholly
indifferent are not to be vowed.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. It is not every duty that is the matter
of a lawful vow. Else you might have as many
vows as duties: every good thought, and word, and
deed might have a vow. And then every sin which
you commit would be accompanied and aggravated
with the guilt of perjury. And no wise man would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">{567}</a></span>
run his soul into such a snare. <i>Object.</i> But do we
not in baptism vow obedience to God? And doth
not obedience contain every particular duty? <i>Answ.</i>
We vow sincere obedience, but not perfect obedience.
We do not vow that we will never sin, nor neglect
a duty (nor ought we to do so). So that as sincere
obedience respecteth every known duty as that which
we shall practise in the bent of our lives, but not in
perfect constancy or degree, so far our vow in baptism
hath respect to all known duties, but no further.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. To make a vow lawful, besides the goodness
of the thing which we vow, there must be a rational,
discernible probability, that the act of vowing
it will do more good than hurt; and this to a wise,
foreseeing judgment. For this vowing is not an ordinary
worship to be offered to God (except the baptismal
vow, renewed in the Lord's supper and at other
seasons); but it is left as an extraordinary means,
for certain ends, which cannot by ordinary means be
attained: and therefore we must discern the season,
by discerning the necessity or usefulness of it. Swearing
is a part of the service of God, but not of his
daily worship, nor frequently and rashly to be used,
by any that would not be held guilty of taking the
name of God in vain: and so it is in the case of
vowing. Therefore he that will make a lawful
vow, must see beforehand, what is the probable
benefit of it, and what is the probable hurt or danger:
and without this foresight it must be rash, and
cannot be lawful. And therefore no one can make
a lawful vow, but wise, foreseeing persons, and those
that advise with such, and are guided by them, if
they be not such themselves; unless in a case
where God hath prescribed by his own determining
commands (as in the covenant of christianity).
Therefore to one man the same vow may be a sin,
that to another may be a duty; because one may
have more reason for it, or necessity of it, and less
danger by it, than another. One man may foresee
that vowing (in case where there is no necessity)
may insnare him either in perplexing doubts, or
terrors, which will make all his life after more irregular
or uncomfortable. Another man may discern
that he is liable to no such danger.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. No man should pretend danger or
scruple against his renewing the vow of christianity,
or any one essential part of it; viz. To take God
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost for my God, and
Saviour, and Sanctifier, my Owner, Governor, and
Father; renouncing the devil, the world, and the
flesh. Because there is an absolute necessity, <i>præcepti
et medii</i>, of performing this, and he that doth it
not shall certainly be damned; and therefore no
worse matter can stand up against it: he that denieth
it, giveth up himself despairingly to damnation.
Yet I have heard many say, I dare not promise to
turn to God, and live a holy life, lest I break this
promise, and be worse than before. But dost thou
not know, that it must be both made and kept, if
thou wilt be saved? Wilt thou choose to be damned,
for fear of worse? There is but one remedy for
thy soul, and all the hope of thy salvation lieth upon
that alone. And wilt thou refuse that one, for fear lest
thou cast it up and die? when thou shalt certainly die
unless thou both take it, and keep it, and digest it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. About particular sins and duties,
deliberate resolutions are the ordinary means of governing
our lives; and vows must not be used where
these will do the work without them. For extraordinary
means must not be used, when ordinary will
serve the turn. Nor must you needlessly draw a
double guilt upon yourselves in case of sinning. And
in mutable or doubtful cases, a resolution may be
changed, when a vow cannot. Try therefore what
deliberate resolutions will do, with the help of other
ordinary means, before you go any further.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. When ordinary resolutions and other
helps will not serve the turn, to engage the will to
the forbearance of a known sin, or the performance
of a known duty, but temptations are so strong as to
bear down all, then it is seasonable to bind ourselves
by a solemn vow, so it be cautelously and deliberately
done, and no greater danger like to follow. In such a
case of necessity, 1. You must deliberate on the benefits
and need. 2. You must foresee all the assaults that
you are like to have to tempt you to perjury, that
they come not unexpected. 3. You must join the
use of all other means for the keeping of your vows.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Make not a law and religion to yourselves
by your voluntary vows, which God never
made you by his authority; nor bind yourselves for
futurity to all that is a duty at present, where it is
possible that the change of things may change your
duty. God is our King and Governor, and not we
ourselves: it is not we, but he, that must give laws
to us. We have work enough to do of his appointing;
we need not make more to ourselves, as if he
had not given us enough. Vows are not to make us
new duties or religions, but to further us in the obedience
of that which our Lord hath imposed on us.
It is a self-condemning sin of foolish will-worshippers,
to be busy in laying more burdens on themselves,
when they know they cannot do so much as
God requireth of them. Yea, some of them murmur
at God's laws as too strict, and at the observers of
them as too precise, (though they come far short of
what is their duty,) and yet will be cutting out more
work for themselves.</p>

<p>And it is not enough that what you vow be your
duty at the present, but you must bind yourselves to
it by vows no longer than it shall remain your duty.
It may be your duty at the present to live a single
life; but if you will vow therefore that you will
never marry, you may bind yourselves to that which
may prove your sin: you know not what alterations
may befall you in your body or estate, that may
invite you to it. Are you sure that no change shall
make it necessary to you? Or will you presume
to bind God himself by your vows, that he shall
make no such alteration? Or if you were never so
confident of your own unchangeableness, you know
not what fond and violent affections another may be
possessed with, which may make an alteration in
your duty. At the present it may be your duty to
live retiredly, and avoid magistracy and public employments:
but you may not vow it therefore for
continuance; for you know not but God may make
such alterations, as may make it so great and plain
a duty, as without flat impiety or cruelty, you cannot
refuse. Perhaps at the present it may be your duty
to give half your yearly revenues to charitable and
pious uses: but you must not therefore vow it for
continuance (without some special cause to warrant
it); for perhaps the next year it may be your duty
to give but a fourth or a tenth part, or none at all,
according as the providence of God shall dispose of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">{568}</a></span>
your estate and you. Perhaps God may impose a
clear necessity on you, of using your estate some
other way.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. If you be under government, you may
not lawfully vow without your governors' consent,
to do any thing which you may not lawfully do without
their consent, in case you had not vowed it. For
that were, 1. Actually to disobey them at the present,
by making a vow without the direction and
consent of your governors. 2. And thereby to bind
yourselves to disobey them for the future, by doing
that without them, which you should not do without
them. But if it be a thing that you may do, or must
do, though your governors forbid you, then you may
vow it though they forbid you (if you have a call
from the necessity of the vow).</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. If oaths be commanded us by usurpers
that have no authority to impose them, we must
not take them in formal obedience to their commands.
For that were to own their usurpation and encourage
them in their sin. If we owe them no obedience in
any thing, we must not obey them in so great a
thing: or if they have some authority over us in
other matters, but none in this, (as a constable hath
no power to give an oath,) we must not obey them
in the point where they have no authority. But yet
it is possible that there may be other reasons that
may make it our duty to do it, though not as an act
of formal obedience: as I may take an oath when a
thief or murderer requireth it, not to obey him, but
to save my life. And if any man command me to
do that which God commandeth me, I must do it,
because God commandeth it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. If a lawful magistrate impose an
oath or vow upon you, before you take it you must
consult with God, and know that it is not against
his will. God must be first obeyed in all things;
but especially in matters of so great moment, as vows
and promises.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> I. What if I be in doubt whether the oath
or promise imposed be lawful? must I take it, or
not? If I take an oath which I judge unlawful or
false, I am a perjured or profane despiser of God:
and if a man must refuse all oaths or promises, which
the magistrate commandeth, if he do but doubt
whether they be lawful, then government and justice
will be injured, while every man that hath ignorance
enough to make him dubious, shall refuse all oaths
and promises of allegiance, or for witness to the truth.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I. I shall tell you what others say first in
the case of doubting. Dr. Sanderson saith, Prælect.
iii. sect. 10, p. 74, 75, <i>Tertius casus est cum quis
juramento pollicetur se facturum aliquid in se fortassis
licitum, quod tamen ipse putat esse illicitum. Ut siquis
ante hæc tempora admittendus ad beneficium (ut vocant)
ecclesiasticum, promisisset in publicis sacris observare
omnes ritus legibus ecclesiasticis imperatos; vestem
scilicet lineam, crucis signum ad sacrum fontem, ingeniculationem
in percipiendis symbolis in sacra cœna, et
id genus alios; quos ipse tamen ex aliquo levi prejudicio
putaret esse superstitiosos et papisticos: quæritur in
hoc casu quæ sit obligatio? Pro Resp. dico tria: Dico</i>
1. <i>Non posse tale juramentum durante tali errore sine
gravi peccato suscipi. Peccat enim graviter qui contra
conscientiam peccat, etsi erroneam. Judicium enim intellectus
cum sit unicuique proxima agendi regula;
voluntas, si judicium illud non sequatur, deficiens a regula
sua, necesse est ut in obliquum feratur. Tritum
est illud, Qui facit contra conscientiam ædificat ad
gehennam. Sane qui jurat in id quod putat esse illicitum,
nihilominus juraturus esset, si esset revera illicitum:
atque ita res illa, ut ut alii licita, est tamen ipsi
illicita: sententiam ferente apostolo, Rom.</i> xiv. 14, <i>&amp;c.</i>
<i>Dico</i> 2. <i>Tale juramentum non obligare, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;&mdash; That
is, The third case is, when a man promiseth by oath
that he will do a thing which in itself perhaps is
lawful, but he thinketh to be unlawful: as if one before
these times being to be admitted to an ecclesiastical
benefice, (as they call it,) had promised, that in
public worship he would observe all the rites commanded
in the ecclesiastic laws, to wit, the surplice,
the sign of the cross at the sacred font, kneeling in
the receiving of the symbols in the holy supper, and
others the like; which yet out of some light prejudice,
he thought to be superstitious and papistical.
The question is, what obligation there is in this case?
For answer I say three things: 1. I say that an oath,
while such an error lasteth, cannot be taken without
grievous sin; for he grievously sinneth, who sinneth
against his conscience, although it be erroneous.
For when the judgment of the intellect is to every
man the nearest rule of action, it must be that the
will is carried into obliquity, if it follow not that
judgment, as swerving from its rule. It is a common
saying, He that doth against his conscience, buildeth
unto hell: verily he that sweareth to that which he
thinketh to be unlawful, would nevertheless swear if
it were indeed unlawful. And so the thing, though
lawful to another, is to him unlawful, the apostle
passing the sentence, Rom. xiv. 14, &amp;c. 2. I say,
that such an oath bindeth not, &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash; Of the
obligation I shall speak anon;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span>
but of the oath or
promise, I think the truth lieth here as followeth.</p>

<p>1. The question <i>de esse</i> must first be resolved, before
the question of knowing or opinion. Either the
thing is really lawful which is doubted of, or denied,
or it is not. If it be not, then it is a sin to swear or
promise to it; and here there is no case of error. But
if it be really lawful, and the vowing of it lawful,
then the obligations that lie upon this man are these,
and in this order: (1.) To have a humble suspicion
of his own understanding. (2.) To search, and
learn, and use all means to discern it to be what it is.
(3.) In the use of these means to acknowledge the
truth. (4.) And then to promise and obey accordingly.
Now this being his duty, and the order of his
duty, you cannot say that he is not obliged to any
one part of it, though he be obliged to do it all in
this order, and therefore not to do the last first,
without the former: for though you question an
hundred times, What shall he do as long as he cannot
see the truth? the law of God is still the same;
and his error doth not disoblige him: <i>Nemini debetur
commodum ex sua culpa</i>. So many of these acts
as he omitteth, so much he sinneth. It is his sin if
he obey not the magistrate; and it is his sin that he
misjudgeth of the thing; and his sin that he doth not
follow the use of the means till he be informed. So
that his erring conscience entangleth him in a necessity
of sinning; but disobligeth him not at all from
his obedience. 2. But yet this is certain, that in
such a case, he that will swear because man biddeth
him, when he taketh it to be false, is a perjured,
profane despiser of God; but he that forbeareth to
swear for fear of sinning against God, is guilty only
of a pardonable, involuntary weakness.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Take heed lest the secret prevalency
of carnal ends or interest, and of fleshly wisdom, do
bias your judgment, and make you stretch your consciences
to take those vows or promises, which otherwise
you would judge unlawful, and refuse. Never good
cometh by following the reasonings and interest of
the flesh, even in smaller matters; much less in
cases of such great importance. Men think it fitteth
them at the present, and doth the business which
they feel most urgent; but it payeth them home with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">{569}</a></span>
troubles and perplexities at the last: it is but like a
draught of cold water in a fever. You have some
present char to do, or some strait to pass through,
in which you think that such an oath, or promise,
or profession would much accommodate you; and
therefore you venture on it, perhaps to your perdition.
It is a foolish course to cure the parts (yea,
the more ignoble parts) with the neglect and detriment
of the whole: it is but like those that cure the
itch by anointing themselves with quicksilver; which
doth the char for them, and sendeth them after to
their graves, or casteth them into some far worse
disease. Remember how deceitful a thing the heart
is, and how subtly such poison of carnal ends will
insinuate itself. Oh how many thousands hath this
undone! that before they are aware, have their wills
first charmed and inclined to the forbidden thing,
and fain would have it to be lawful; and then have
brought themselves to believe it lawful, and so to
commit the sin; and next to defend it, and next to
become the champions of Satan, to fight his battles,
and vilify and abuse them, that by holy wisdom and
tenderness have kept themselves from the deceit.</p>

<h3><i>Tit. 2. Directions against Perjury and Perfidiousness:
Land for keeping Vows and Oaths.</i></h3>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Be sure that you have just apprehension
of the greatness of the sin of perjury.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span>
Were it
seen of men in its proper shape, it would more
affright them from it than a sight of the devil
himself would do. I shall show it you in part in
these particulars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The heinousness of perjury.</div>

<p>1. It containeth a lie, and hath all
the malignity in it which I before
showed to be in lying, with much
more. 2. Perjury is a denial or contempt of God. He
that appealeth to his judgment by an oath, and doth
this in falsehood,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span>
doth show that either he believeth
not that there is a God,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span>
or that he believeth not
that he is the righteous Governor of the world, who
will justly determine all the causes that belong to
his tribunal. The perjured person doth as it were
bid defiance to God, and setteth him at nought, as
one that is not able to be avenged on him. 3. Perjury
is a calling for the vengeance of God against
yourselves. You invite God to plague you, as if you
bid him do his worst: you appeal to him for judgment
in your guilt, and you shall find that he will
not hold you guiltless. Imprecations against yourselves
are implied in your oaths: he that sweareth
doth say in effect, Let God judge and punish me as
a perjured wretch, if I speak not the truth. And it
is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living
God, for vengeance is his and he will recompence,
Heb. x. 30, 31: and when he judgeth the
wicked, "he is a consuming fire," Heb. xii. 29.
4. Perjury and perfidiousness are sins that leave the
conscience no ease of an extenuation or excuse; but
it is so heinous a villany, that it is the seed of self-tormenting
desperation. Some sins conscience can
make shift a while to hide, by saying, It is a controversy;
and, Many wise men are of another mind;
but perjury is a sin which heathens and infidels
bear as free a testimony against (in their way) as
christians do. Some sins are shifted off by saying,
They are little ones. But<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span>
christians and heathens
are agreed that perjury is a sin almost as great as
the devil can teach his servants to commit. Saith
Plutarch,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_57" id="Ref_57" href="#Foot_57">[57]</a></span>
He that deceiveth his enemy by an oath,
doth confess thereby, that he feareth his enemy, and
despiseth God. Saith Cicero, The penalty of perjury
is destruction from God, and shame from man.
Saith Q. Curtius, Perfidiousness is a crime which no
merits can mitigate. Read Cicero de Offic. lib. iii.
Saith Aristotle, He that will extenuate an oath, must
say, that those villanous wretches that think God
seeth not, do think also to go away with their perjury
unpunished. In a word, the heathens commonly
take the revenge of perjury to belong in so
special a manner to the gods, that they conclude
that man, and usually his posterity, to be destinated
to ruin, that is perjured and perfidious: insomuch
that it is written<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span>
of Agesilaus and many others, that
when their enemies were perjured, and broke their
covenants, they took it for a sign of victory, and the
best prognostic of their success against them. Plutarch
recordeth this story of Clemens, that having
made a truce for seven days with the Argives, he set
upon them, and killed and took many of them in the
night; and when he was charged with perfidiousness,
answered, I made not a truce with them for
seven nights, but for seven days. But the women
fetched arms out of the temples of the gods, and
repulsed him with shame, and he ran mad, and with
his sword did mangle his own body, and died in a
most hideous manner. When conscience is awakened
to see such a sin as perjury, no wonder if such
run mad, or hang themselves; as perfidious Ahithophel
and Judas did. No doubt but everlasting horror
and desperation will be the end of such, if true
conversion do not prevent it. 5. It is a sin that
ruineth families and societies,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span>
like fire that being
kindled in the thatch, never stoppeth till it have
consumed all the house. Though "the curse of the
Lord is in the house of the wicked, but he blesseth
the habitation of the just," Prov. iii. 33; yet among
all the wicked, there are few so commonly marked
out with their families to shame and ruin, as the
perjured. Whatever nation is stigmatized with a
<i>fides Punica vel Græca</i>, with the brand of perjury, it
is not only their greatest infamy, but, like "Lord,
have mercy on us" written on your doors, a sign of
a destroying plague within.<span

are virtually treason, rebellion, and murder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">{570}</a></span>
against kings and magistrates, and no more to
be favoured in a kingdom, by a king that loveth his
life and safety, than the plague in a city, or poison to
the body. <i>Tristissimum et domesticum regibus omnibus
pharmacum, liberorum, amicorum et exercitus perfidia</i>,
saith Appian. What security have princes of
their crowns, or lives, where oaths and covenants
seem not obligatory? There is then nothing left
but fear of punishment to restrain the violence of
any one that would do them mischief; and craft or
strength will easily break the bonds of fear. He
that would dissolve the bond of oaths, and teach men
to make light of perjury, is no more to be endured
in a kingdom, than he that openly inviteth the subjects
to kill their king, or rise up in rebellion against
him. If he that breaketh the least of God's commands,
and teacheth men so to do, shall be called
least in the kingdom of God, Matt. v. 19, then surely
he that breaketh the great commands by the most
odious sin of perjury, and teacheth men so to do,
should neither be great, nor any thing, in the kingdoms
of men. 7. Perjury is the poison of all societies,
and of friendship, and of human converse, and
turneth all into a state of enmity, or hostility, and
teacheth all men to live together like foes. He that
is not to be believed when he sweareth, is never to
be believed: and when oaths and covenants signify
nothing, and no man can believe another, what are
they but as so many foes to one another? How
can there be any relations of governors and subjects?
of husband and wife? of master and servants? or
how can there be any trading or commerce, when
there is no trust? Perjury dissolveth all societies
by loosening all the bonds of association. Well
might Dionys. Halic. lib. iii. say, The perfidious are
far worse than open enemies, and worthy of far
greater punishment. For a man may more easily
avoid the ambushments of foes, and repel their assaults,
than escape the perfidiousness of seeming
friends. Saith Val. Max. lib. ix. c. 6, Perfidiousness
is a hidden and insnaring mischief; whose effectual
force is in lying and deceiving: its fruit consisteth
in some horrid villany; which is ripe and sure
when it hath compassed cruelty with wicked hands;
bringing as great mischief to mankind, as fidelity
bringeth good and safety. He that teacheth the doctrine
of perjury and perfidiousness, doth bid every
man shift for himself, and trust no more his friend
or neighbour, but all take heed of one another, as
so many serpents or wild beasts. Lions and bears
may better be suffered to live loose among men, than
those that teach men to make light of oaths. 8.
Thus also it destroyeth personal love, and teacheth
all men to be haters of each other: for it can be no
better when men become such hateful creatures to
each other, as not at all to be credited or sociably
conversed with. 9. Perjury and perfidiousness do
proclaim men deplorate; and stigmatize them with
this character, that they are persons that will stick
at the committing of no kind of villany in the world,
further than their fleshly interest hindereth them.
No charity bindeth a man to think that he will
make conscience of murder, rebellion, deceit, adultery,
or any imaginable wickedness, who maketh no
conscience of perjury and perfidiousness. Such a
person alloweth you to judge that if the temptation
serve, he will do any thing that the devil bids him:
and that he is virtually a compound of all iniquity,
and prepared for every evil work. 10. Lastly, as
perjury doth thus dissolve societies, and turn mankind
into enmity with each other, so it would make the
misery uncurable, by making even penitents incredible.
Who will believe him, even while he professeth
to repent, that hath showed that when he sweareth
he is not to be believed? He that dare forswear
himself, dare lie when he pretendeth repentance for
his perjury. It must be some deeds that are more
credible than words and oaths, that must recover the
credit of such a man's professions. If perjury have
violated any relations, it leaveth the breach almost
uncurable, because no professions of repentance or
future fidelity can be trusted. Thus I have partly
showed you the malignity of perjury and covenant-breaking.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Be sure that you make no vow or
covenant which God hath forbidden you to keep.
It is rash vowing and swearing which is the common
cause of perjury. You should, at the making of
your vow, have seen into the bottom of it, and
foreseen all the evils that might follow it, and the
temptations which were like to draw you into perjury.
He is virtually perjured as soon as he hath
sworn, who sweareth to do that which he must not
do; the preventive means are here the best.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Be sure you take no oath or vow which
you are not sincerely resolved to perform.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61" href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span>
They
that swear or vow with a secret reserve, that rather
than they will be ruined by keeping it, they will break
it, are habitually and reputatively perjured persons,
even before they break it; besides that, they show
a base, hypocritical, profligate conscience, that can
deliberately commit so great a sin.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. See that all fleshly, worldly interest
be fully subdued to the interest of your souls, and to
the will of God. He that at the heart sets more by
his body than his soul, and loveth his worldly prosperity
above God, will lie, or swear, or forswear, or
do any thing to save that carnal interest which he
most valueth. He that is carnal and worldly at the
heart, is false at the heart; the religion of such a
hypocrite will give place to his temporal safety or
commodity, and will carry him no further than the
way is fair. It is no wonder that a proud man, or a
worldling, will renounce both God and his true felicity
for the world, seeing indeed he taketh it for
his god and his felicity; even as a believer will renounce
the world for God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62" href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Beware of inordinate fear of man, and
of a distrustful withdrawing of your heart from God.
Else you will be carried to comply with the will of
man before the will of God, and to avoid the wrath
of man before the wrath of God. Read and fear that
heavy curse, Jer. xvii. 5, 6. God is unchangeable,
and hath commanded you so far to imitate him, as
"If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or swear an
oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break
his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth
out of his mouth," Numb. xxx. 2. But man is mutable,
and so is his interest and his affairs; and therefore
if you are the servants of men, you must swear
one year, and forswear it, or swear the contrary, the
next: when their interest requireth it, you must not
be thought worthy to live among men, if you
will not promise or swear as they command you;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">{571}</a></span>
and when their interest altereth and requireth the
contrary, you must hold all those bonds to be but
straws, and break them for their ends.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Be sure that you lose not the fear of
God, and the tenderness of your consciences. When
these are lost, your understanding, and sense, and
life are lost; and you will not stick at the greatest
wickedness; nor know when you have done it, what
you did. If faith see not God continually present,
and foresee not the great approaching day, perjury
or any villany will seem tolerable, for worldly ends:
for when you look but to men's present case, you
will see that "the righteous and the wise, and their
works, are in the hands of God; no man knoweth love
or hatred by all that is before them. All things come
alike to all; there is one event to the righteous, and
to the wicked; to the good, and to the clean, and to
the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and
he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath," Eccles.
ix. 1, 2. But in the end, men "shall discern between
the righteous and the wicked," Mal. iii. 18. Therefore
it is the believing foresight of the end, that by
preserving the fear of God and tenderness of conscience,
must save you from this, and all other
heinous sin.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Be not bold and rash about such
dreadful things as vows. Run not as fearlessly upon
them as if you were but going to your dinner; the
wrath of God is not to be jested with. <i>Usque ad aras</i>,
was the bounds even of a heathen's kindness to his
friend. Meddle with oaths with the greatest fear,
and caution, and circumspection. It is terrible here
to find that you were mistaken, through any temerity,
or negligence, or secret seduction of a carnal
interest.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. Especially be very fearful of owning
any public doctrine, or doing any public act, which
tendeth to harden others in their perjury, or to encourage
multitudes to commit the sin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span>
To be forsworn
yourselves is a dreadful case; but to teach
whole nations or churches to forswear themselves,
or to plead for it, or justify it as a lawful
thing, is much more dreadful. And though you
teach not or own not perjury under the name of perjury,
yet if first you will make plain perjury to seem
no perjury, that so you may justify it, it is still a
most inhuman, horrid act. God knoweth I insult
not over the papists, with a delight to make any
christians odious! but with grief I remember how
lamentably they have abused our holy profession,
while not only their great doctors, but their approved
general council at the Lateran under Pope Innocent
the Third, in the third canon hath decreed that the
pope may depose temporal lords from their dominions,
and give them unto others, and discharge their
vassals from their allegiance and fidelity, if they be
heretics, or will not exterminate heretics (even such
as the holy men there condemned were, in the pope's
account). To declare to many christian nations, that
it is lawful to break their oaths and promises to their
lawful lords and rulers, or their vows to God, and to
undertake, by defending or owning this, to justify all
those nations that shall be guilty of this perjury and
perfidiousness, oh what a horrid crime is this! what
a shame even unto human nature! and how great a
wrong to the christian name!</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Understand and remember these following
rules, to acquaint you how far a vow is obligatory:
which I shall give you for the most part out of
Dr. Sanderson, because his decisions of these cases
are now of best esteem.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> I. The general rule laid down Numb. xxx. 2,
3, doth make a vow, as such, to be obligatory, though
the party should have a secret equivocation or intent,
that though he speak the words to deceive
another, yet he will not oblige himself. Such a reserve
not to oblige himself hindereth not the obligation,
but proveth him a perfidious hypocrite. Dr.
Sanderson, p. 23, <i>Juramentum omne ex sua natura est
obligatorium: ita ut si quis juret non intendens se obligare,
nihilominus tamen suscipiendo juramentum ipso
facto obligetur</i>: that is, If he so far understand what
he doth, as that his words may bear the definition of
an oath or vow; otherwise if he speak the words of
an oath in a strange language, thinking they signify
something else, or if he speak in his sleep, or deliration,
or distraction, it is no oath, and so not
obligatory.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> II. Those conditions are to be taken as intended
in all oaths, (whether expressed or no,)
which the very nature of the thing doth necessarily
imply<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span>
(unless any be so brutish as to express the
contrary). And these are all reducible to two heads:
1. A natural, and, 2. A moral impossibility. 1.
Whoever sweareth to do any thing, or give any
thing, is supposed to mean, If I live; and if I be not
disabled in my body, faculties, estate; if God make
it not impossible to be, &amp;c. For no man can be
supposed to mean, I will do it whether God will or
not, and whether I live or not, and whether I be
able or not. 2. Whoever voweth or sweareth to do
any thing, must be understood to mean it, If no
change of providence make it a sin; or if I find not,
contrary to my present supposition, that God forbiddeth
it. For no man that is a christian is to be supposed
to mean when he voweth, I will do this,
though God forbid it, or though it prove to be a sin;
especially when men therefore vow it, because they
take it to be a duty. Now as that which is sinful is
morally impossible, so there are divers ways by
which a thing may appear or become sinful to us.
(1.) When we find it forbidden directly in the word
of God, which at first we understood not. (2.)
When the change of things doth make that a sin,
which before was a duty; of which may be given an
hundred instances; as when the change of a man's
estate, of his opportunities, of his liberty, of his parts
and abilities, of objects, of customs, of the laws of
civil governors, doth change the very matter of his
duty.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But will every change disoblige us? If
not, what change must it be? seeing casuists use to
put it as a condition in general, <i>rebus sic stantibus</i>.
<i>Answ.</i> No: it is not every change of things that disobligeth
us from the bonds of a vow. For then
vows were of no considerable signification. But, 1.
If the very matter that was vowed, or about which
the vow was, do cease, <i>cessante materia, cessat obligatio</i>:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span>
as if I promise to teach a pupil, I am disobliged
when he is dead. If I promise to pay so
much money in gold, and the king should forbid
gold and change his coin, I am not obliged to it. 2.
<i>Cessante termino vel correlato, cessat obligatio</i>: If the
party die to whom I am bound, my personal obligation
ceaseth. And so the conjugal bond ceaseth at
death, and civil bonds by civil death. 3. <i>Cessante
fine, cessat obligatio</i>: If the use and end wholly
cease, my obligation, which was only to that use
and end, ceaseth. As if a physician promise to give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">{572}</a></span>
physic for nothing for the cure of the plague, to all
the poor of the city; when the plague ceaseth,
his end, and so his obligation, ceaseth. 4. <i>Cessante
persona naturali relata, cessat obligatio personalis</i>:
When the natural person dieth, the obligation
ceaseth. I cannot be obliged to do that when I am
dead, which is proper to the living. The subject of
the obligation ceasing, the accidents must cease. 5.
<i>Cessante relatione vel persona civili, cessat obligatio
talis, qua talis</i>: The obligation which lay on a person
in any relation merely as such, doth cease when
that relation ceaseth. A king is not bound to govern
or protect his subjects if they traitorously depose
him, or if he cast them off, and take another
kingdom (as when Henry III. of France left the
kingdom of Poland): nor are subjects bound to allegiance
and obedience to him that is not indeed their
king. A judge, or justice, or constable, or tutor, is
no longer bound by his oath to do the offices of these
relations, than he continueth in the relation. A divorced
wife is not bound by her conjugal vow to her
husband as before, nor masters and servants, when
their relations cease; nor a soldier to his general by
his military sacrament, when the army is disbanded,
or he is cashiered or dismissed.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> III. No vows or promises of our own can
dissolve the obligation laid upon us by the law of
God. For we have no co-ordinate, much less superior
authority over ourselves; our self-obligations
are but for the furthering of our obedience.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> IV. Therefore no vows can disoblige a man
from any present duty, nor justify him in the committing
of any sin. Vows are to engage us to God,
and not against him: if the matter which we vow be
evil, it is a sin to vow it, and a sin to do it upon
pretence of a vow. Sin is no acceptable sacrifice to
God.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> V. If I vow that I will do some duty better,
I am not thereby disobliged from doing it at all,
when I am disabled from doing it better.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span>
Suppose
a magistrate, seeing much amiss in church and commonwealth,
doth vow a reformation, and vow against
the abuses which he findeth; if now the people's
obstinacy and rebellion disable him to perform that
vow, it doth not follow that he must lay down his
sceptre, and cease to govern them at all, because he
cannot do it as he ought, if he were free. So if the
pastors of any church do vow the reformation of
church abuses, in their places, if they be hindered
by their rulers, or by the people, it doth not follow
that they must lay down their callings, and not worship
God publicly at all, because they cannot do it
as they would, and ought if they were free; as long
as they may worship him without committing any
sin. God's first obligation on me is to worship him,
and the second for the manner, to do it as near his
order as I can: now if I cannot avoid the imperfections
of worship, though I vowed it, I must not
therefore avoid the worship itself (as long as corruptions
destroy not the very nature of it, and I am
put myself upon no actual sin). For I was bound to
worship God before my vows, and in order of nature
before my obligation <i>de modo</i>: and my vow was
made with an implied condition, that the thing were
possible and lawful: and when that ceaseth to be
possible or lawful which I vowed, I must, nevertheless,
do that which still remaineth possible and lawful.
To give over God's solemn worship with the
church, is no reformation. To prefer no worship
before imperfect worship, is a greater deformation
and corruption, than to prefer imperfect worship before
that which is more perfect. And to prefer a
worship imperfect in the manner, before no church
worship at all, is a greater reformation than to prefer
a more perfect manner of worship before a more
imperfect and defective. To worship God decently
and in order, supposeth that he must be worshipped;
and he that doth not worship at all, doth not worship
him decently. If a physician vow that he will
administer a certain effectual antidote to all his
patients that have the plague, and that he will not
administer a certain less effectual preparation, which
some apothecaries, through covetousness or carelessness,
had brought into common use, to the injury of
the sick; his vow is to be interpreted with these exceptions:
I will do it if I can, without dishonesty or
a greater mischief: I will not administer the sophisticated
antidote when I can have better: I vow this
for my patients' benefit, and not for their destruction.
Therefore if the sophisticated antidote is much
better than none, and may save men's lives, and the
patients grow wilful and will take no other, or
authority forbid the use of any other, the physician
is neither bound to forsake his calling rather than
use it, nor to neglect the life of his patients (if their
lives indeed lie upon his care, and they may not be
in some good hopes without him, and the good of
many require him not to neglect a few). But he
must do what he can, when he cannot do what he
would, and only show that he consenteth not to the
sophistication.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> VI. Though he that voweth a lawful thing,
must be understood to mean, if it continue possible
and lawful; yet if he himself be the culpable cause
that afterwards it becometh impossible or unlawful,
he violateth his vow. He that voweth to give so
much to the poor, and after prodigally wasteth it,
and hath it not to give, doth break his vow; which
he doth not if fire or thieves deprive him of it
against his will. He that voweth to preach the
gospel, if he cut out his own tongue, or culpably
procure another to imprison, silence, or hinder him,
doth break his vow; which he did not if the hinderance
were involuntary and insuperable: consent
doth make the impedition his own act.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> VII. In the taking and keeping of oaths and
vows we must deal simply and openly without equivocation
and deceit.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span>
Psal. xxiv. 3-5, "Who shall
ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand
in his holy place? He that hath clean hands, and a
pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto
vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. He shall receive the
blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the
God of his salvation."</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> VIII. He that juggleth or stretcheth his
conscience by fraudulent shifts and interpretations
afterwards, is as bad as he that dissembleth in the
taking of the oath. To break it by deceit, is as bad
as to take it in deceit. Psal. xv. 1, 4, "Lord, who
shall abide in thy tabernacle&mdash;he that sweareth to
his own hurt and changeth not." Saith Dr. Sanderson,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_68" id="Ref_68" href="#Foot_68">[68]</a></span>
<i>Ista mihi aut non cogitare</i>, &amp;c. "It seemeth to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">{573}</a></span>
me that the greater part of the men of these times
either think not of these things, or at least not seriously;
who fear not, at large and in express words,
without going about, to swear to all that, whatever
it be, which is proposed to them by those that have
power to hurt them: yea, and they take themselves
for the only wise men, and not without some disdain
deride the simplicity and needless fear of those, that
lest they hurt their consciences forsooth, do seek a
knot in a rush, and oppose the forms prescribed by
those that have power to prescribe them. And in
the mean time they securely free themselves from
all crime and fear of perjury, and think they have
looked well to themselves and their consciences, if
either when they swear, like Jesuits, they can defend
themselves by the help of some tacit equivocation,
or mental reservation, or subtle interpretation
which is strained and utterly alien from the words;
or else after they have sworn can find some thing to
slip through, some cunning evasion, as a wise remedy,
by which they may so elude their oath, as that
keeping the words, the sense may by some sophism
be eluded, and all the force of it utterly enervated.
The ancient christians knew not this divinity, nor
the sounder heathens this moral philosophy. For
otherwise saith Augustine, They are perjured, who
keeping the words, deceive the expectation of those
they swear to: and otherwise saith Cicero," &amp;c.
He goeth on to confirm it at large by argument.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> IX. An oath is to be taken and interpreted
strictly. Sanderson saith,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_69" id="Ref_69" href="#Foot_69">[69]</a></span>
<i>Juramenti obligatio est
stricti juris</i>; that is, <i>non ut excludat juris interpretationem
æquitate temperatam; sed ut excludat juris interpretationem
gratia corruptam</i>: "not as excluding an
equitable interpretation, but as excluding an interpretation
corrupted by partiality:" that it be a just
interpretation, between the extremes of rigid, and
favourable or partial; and in doubtful cases it is
safer to follow the strict, than the benign or favourable
sense. It is dangerous stretching and venturing
too far in matters of so sacred a nature, and of such
great importance as vows and oaths.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> X. In the exposition of such doubtful oaths
and vows, 1. We must specially watch against self-interest
or commodity, that it corrupt not our understandings.
2. And we must not take our oaths or
any part of them in such a sense, as a pious, prudent
stander-by that is impartial, and no whit interested
in the business, cannot easily find in the words
themselves.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XI. In doubtful cases the greatest danger
must be most carefully avoided, and the safer side
preferred: but the danger of the soul by perjury is
the greatest, and therefore no bodily danger should
so carefully be avoided: and therefore an oath that
in the common and obvious sense seemeth unlawful
should not be taken, unless there be very full evidence
that it hath another sense. Sand. p. 46, <i>Nititur
autem</i>, &amp;c. This reason leaneth on that general
and most useful rule, that in doubtful cases we must
follow the safer side: but it is safer not to swear,
where the words of the oath proposed, do seem according
to the common and obvious sense of the
words to contain in them something unlawful; than
by a loose interpretation so to lenify them for our
own ends, that we may the more securely swear
them. For it is plain that such an oath may be refused
without the peril of perjury; but not that it
can be taken without some danger or fear. The
same rule must guide us also in keeping vows.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XII. It is ordinarily resolved that imposed
oaths must be kept according to the sense of the
imposer. See Sanders. p. 191, 192. But I conceive
that assertion must be more exactly opened and
bounded. 1. Where justice requireth that we have
respect to the will or right of the imposer, there the
oath imposed must be taken in his sense; but whether
it must be kept in his sense is further to be
considered. 2. When I have done my best to understand
the sense of the imposer in taking the oath,
and yet mistake it, and so take it (without fraud) in
another sense, the question then is somewhat hard,
whether I must keep it in the sense I took it in, or
in his sense, which then I understood not. If I
must not keep it in my own sense, which I took it
in, then it would follow that I must keep another
oath, and not that which I took: for it is the sense
that is the oath. And I never obliged myself to any
thing, but according to my own sense: and yet on
the other side, if every man may take oaths in their
private sense, then oaths will not attain their ends,
nor be any security to the imposers.</p>

<p>In this case you must carefully distinguish between
the formal obligation of the oath or vow as such,
and the obligation of justice to my neighbour which
is a consequent of my vow. And for the former I
conceive (with submission) that an oath or vow cannot
bind me, formally as such, in any sense but my
own in which <i>bona fide</i> I took it. Because formally
an oath cannot bind me which I never took: but I
never took that which I never meant, nor thought of;
if you so define an oath as to take in the sense,
which is the soul of it.</p>

<p>But then in regard of the consequential obligation
in point of justice unto man, the question I think
must be thus resolved: 1. We must distinguish between
a lawful imposer or contractor, and a violent
usurper or robber that injuriously compelleth us to
swear. 2. Between the obvious, usual sense of the
words, and an unusual, forced sense. 3. Between a
sincere, involuntary misunderstanding the imposer,
and a voluntary, fraudulent reservation or private
sense. 4. Between one that I owe something to
antecedently, and one that I owe nothing to but by
the mere self-obligation of my vow. 5. Between an
imposer that is himself the culpable cause of my
misunderstanding him, and one that is not the cause,
but my own weakness or negligence is the cause.
6. Between a case where both senses may be kept,
and a case where they cannot, being inconsistent.
Upon these distinctions, I thus resolve the question.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> I. If I fraudulently and wilfully take an oath
in a sense of my own, contrary to the sense of the
imposer, and the common and just sense of the words
themselves, I am guilty of perfidiousness and profaneness
in the very taking of it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> II. If it be long of my own culpable ignorance
or negligence that I misunderstood the imposer,
I am not thereby disobliged from the public sense.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> III. When the imposer openly putteth a
sense on the words imposed contrary to the usual,
obvious sense, I am to understand him according to
his own expression, and not to take the oath, as imposed
in any other sense.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> IV. If the imposer refuse or neglect to tell
me his sense any otherwise than in the imposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">{574}</a></span>
words, I am to take and keep them according to the
obvious sense of the words, as they are commonly
used in the time and place which I live in.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> V. If it be long of the imposer's obscurity,
or refusing to explain himself, or other culpable
cause, that I mistook him, I am not bound to keep
my oath in his sense, as different from my own
(unless there be some other reason for it).</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> VI. If the imposer be a robber or usurper,
or one that I owe nothing to in justice, but what I
oblige myself to by my oath, I am not then bound at
all to keep my oath in his sense, if my own sense was
according to the common use of the words.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> VII. Though I may not lie to a robber or
tyrant that unjustly imposeth promises or oaths
upon me, yet if he put an oath or promise on me
which is good and lawful in the proper, usual sense
of the words, though bad in his sense, (which is
contrary to the plain words,) whether I may take
this to save my liberty or life, I leave to the consideration
of the judicious: that which may be said
against it is, that oaths must not be used indirectly
and dissemblingly: that which may be said for it is,
1. That I have no obligation to fit my words to his
personal, private sense. 2. That I deceive him not,
but only permit him to deceive himself, as long as it
is he and not I that misuseth the words. 3. That I
am to have chief respect to the public sense; and it
is not his sense, but mine, that is the public sense.
4. That the saving of a man's life or liberty is cause
enough for the taking a lawful oath.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> VIII. In case I misunderstood the imposed
oath through my own default, I am bound to keep
it in both senses, (my own and the imposer's,) if both
be consistent and lawful to be done. For I am
bound to it in my own sense, because it was formally
my oath or vow which I intended. And I am bound
to it in his sense, because I have in justice made the
thing his due. As if the king command me to vow
that I will serve him in wars against the Turk; and
I misunderstand him as if he meant only to serve
him with my purse; and so I make a vow with this
intent, to expend part of my estate to maintain that
war; whereas the true sense was that I should serve
him with my person: in this case, I see not but I am
bound to both.</p>

<p>Indeed if it were a promise that obliged me only
to the king, then I am obliged no further and no
longer than he will; for he can remit his own right:
but if by a vow I become obliged directly to God
himself as a party, then no man can remit his right,
and I must perform my vow as made to him.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XIII. If any impose an ambiguous oath, and
refuse to explain it, and require you only to swear
in these words, and leave you to your own sense,
Dr. Sanderson thinketh that an honest man should
suspect some fraud in such an oath, and not take
it at all till all parties are agreed of the sense.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_72" id="Ref_72" href="#Foot_72">[72]</a></span>
And I think he should not take it at all, unless there
be some other cause that maketh it his duty. But
if a lawful magistrate command it, or the interest
of the church or state require it, I see not but he
may take it, on condition that in the plain and proper
sense of the words the oath be lawful, and that he
openly profess to take it only in that sense.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XIV. If any power should impose an oath,
or vow, or promise, which in the proper, usual sense
were downright impious, or blasphemous, or sinful,
and yet bid me take it in what sense I pleased,
though I could take it in such a sense as might
make it no real consent to the impiety, yet it would
be impious in the sense of the world, and of such
heinous consequence as will make it to be unlawful.
As if I must subscribe, or say, or swear these words,
There is no God; or, Scripture is untrue; though it
is easy to use these or any words in a good sense, if
I may put what sense I will upon them, yet the
public sense of them is blasphemy; and I may not
publicly blaspheme, on pretence of a private right
sense and intention.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XV. If the oath imposed be true in the strict
and proper sense, yet if that sense be not vulgarly
known, nor sufficiently manifest to be the imposer's
sense, and if the words are false or blasphemous in
the vulgar sense of those that I have to do with, and
that must observe and make use of my example, I
must not take such an oath, without leave to make
my sense as public as my oath. As if I were commanded
to swear, That God hath no foreknowledge,
no knowledge, no will, &amp;c.; it were easy to prove
that these terms are spoken primarily of man, and
that they are attributed to God but analogically or
metaphorically, and that God hath no such human
acts <i>formaliter</i>, but <i>eminenter</i>, and that <i>forma dat
nomen</i>, and so that strictly it is not knowledge and
will in the primary, proper notion, that God hath at
all, but something infinitely higher, for which man
hath no other name. But though thus the words
are true and justifiable in the strictest, proper sense,
yet are they unlawful, because they are blasphemy
in the vulgar sense: and he that speaks to the vulgar
is supposed to speak with the vulgar; unless he
as publicly explain them.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XVI. If the supreme power should impose
an oath or promise, which in the ordinary, obvious
sense were sinful, and an inferior officer would bid
me take it in what sense I pleased, I might not
therefore take it: because that such an officer hath
no power to interpret it himself; much less to allow
me to take it in a private sense. But if the lawgiver
that imposeth it bid me take it in what sense I will,
and give me leave to make my sense as public as my
oath, I may take it, if the words be but dubious, and
not apparently false or sinful: (so there be no reason
against it, <i>aliunde</i>, as from ill consequents, &amp;c.)</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XVII. If any man will say in such a case,
(when he thinketh that the imposer's sense is bad,)
I take not the same oath or engagement which is
imposed, but another in the same words, and I suppose
not inferior officers authorized to admit any interpretation,
but I look at them only as men that
can actually execute or not execute the laws upon
me; and so I take a vow of my own according to
my own sense, though in their words, as a means of
my avoiding their severities: as this is a collusion in
a very high and tender business, so that person (if
the public sense of the oath be sinful) must make
his professed sense as public as his oath or promise;
it being no small thing to do that which in the public
sense is impious, and so to be an example of perfidiousness
to many.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XVIII. Though an oath imposed by a
usurper or by violence is not to be taken in formal
obedience, nor at all, unless the greatness of the
benefit require it, yet being taken it is nevertheless
obligatory<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span>
(supposing nothing else do make it void).
Man is a free agent, and cannot be forced, though he
may be frightened: if he swear to a thief for the
saving of his life, he voluntarily doth choose the inconveniences
of the oath, as a means to save his life.
Therefore being a voluntary act it is obligatory;
else there should be no obligation on us to suffer for
Christ, but any thing might be sworn or done to
escape suffering: see of this Dr. Sanderson largely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">{575}</a></span>
Prælect. iv. sect. 14-16. The imposition and the
oath are different things: in the imposition, a thief
or tyrant is the party commanding, and I am the
party commanded; and his having no authority to
command me, doth nullify only his command, and
maketh me not obliged to obey him, nor to take it in
any obedience to him; but yet if I do take it without
any authority obliging me, (as private oaths are
taken,) it is still an oath or vow, in which the parties
are God and man; man vowing and making himself
a debtor to God; and God hath authority to require
me to keep my vows, when men have no authority
to require me to make them. All men confess that
private vows bind; and the nullity of the imposer's
authority, maketh them but private vows. This case
is easy, and commonly agreed on.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XIX. If in a complex vow or promise there
be many things which prove materially unlawful,
and one or more that are lawful, the conjunction of
the things unlawful doth not disoblige me from the
vow of doing the lawful part. Otherwise a man
might make void all his vows to God, and oaths and
covenants with men, by putting in something that is
evil with the good; and so God, and the king, and
our neighbours would have their debts paid by our
sin and injury done them on the bye.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XX. If some part of that which you vowed
become impossible, that doth not disoblige you from
so much as remaineth possible. As if you vow allegiance
to the king, and tyrants or disability hinder
you from serving him as subjects in some one particular
way, you remain still obliged to serve him by
those other ways in which you are yet capable to
serve him. So if you had taken an oath against
popery, to preach against it, and reject the practice
of it, and for ever renounce it; this would not bind
you from the common truths and duties of christianity,
which papists hold in common with all other christians:
nor could you preach against popery, if you
were hindered by imprisonment, banishment, or restraint;
but you have still power to forbear approving,
consenting, subscribing, or practising their errors;
and this you are still bound to do.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXI. Though you are not bound to do that
of your vow which changes have made impossible or
unlawful, yet if another change make them possible
and lawful again, your obligation doth return afresh
(unless you made it with such limitation). It is not
a temporary cessation of the matter, or end, or correlate,
that will perpetually discharge you from your
vow. If your wife be taken captive many years,
when she returneth, you are bound to the duties of
a husband. If the king be expelled by usurpers,
you are bound at present to so much duty as is possible,
and to obey him as your actual governor when
he returneth. But in the case of servants and soldiers,
and other temporary relations, it is otherwise;
for a removal may end the relation itself. If you
promise to preach the gospel, to medicate the sick,
to relieve the poor, to reform your families, &amp;c. you
are not hereby obliged to do it while any unresistible
impediment maketh it impossible; but when the
hinderance ceaseth, you are obliged to do it again;
the matter and your capacity being restored.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXII. Therefore many a vow and promise
may be lawfully unperformed, which may not be
renounced or disclaimed. When you are taken captives
you must forbear your duty to your king, your
father, your husband or wife, but you may not therefore
renounce them, and say, I have no obligation to
them: no, not to the death; because they are relations
for life; and how improbable soever it may
seem that you should be returned to them, yet God
can do it, and you must wait on him.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXIII. A former vow or promise is not nullified
by a latter that contradicteth it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_74" id="Ref_74" href="#Foot_74">[74]</a></span>
Otherwise a
man might disoblige himself at his pleasure. Yet
he that maketh contrary vows, obligeth himself to
contraries and impossibles; and bringeth a necessity
of perjury on himself, for not doing the things impossible
which he vowed. And in some cases a later promise
to men may null a former, when we made the
former with the reserve of such a power or liberty,
or are justly supposed to have power, to recall a
former promise: or when it is the duty of a mutable
relation which we vow, (as of a physician, a schoolmaster,
&amp;c.) and by a later vow we change the relation
itself (which we may still lawfully change).</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXIV. The <i>actus jurandi</i> must still be distinguished
from the <i>materia juramenti</i>; and it very
often cometh to pass that the act of swearing (or the
oath as our act) is unlawfully done, and was a sin
from the beginning, and yet it is nevertheless obligatory
as long as the <i>res jurata</i>, the matter sworn, is
lawful or necessary.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span>
Dr. Sanderson instanceth in
Joshua's oath to the Gibeonites. The nature of the
thing is proof enough; for many a thing is sinfully
done, for want of a due call, or manner, or end, that
yet is done, and is no nullity. A man may sinfully
enter upon the ministry, that yet is bound to do the
duty of a minister; and many marriages are sinful
that are no nullities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What is the nullity of an oath.</div>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXV. The nullity of an oath
<i>ab initio</i>, is <i>quando realiter vel reputative
non juravimus</i>; when really or
reputatively we did not swear. The sinfulness of
an oath is when we did swear really but unlawfully
as to the ground, or end, or matter, or manner, or
circumstances. Really that man did not swear,
1. Who spake not (mentally nor orally) the words
of an oath. 2. Who thought those words had signified
no such thing, and so had no intent to swear
either mentally or verbally. As if an Englishman
be taught to use the words of an oath in French,
and made believe that they have a contrary sense.
3. Who only narratively recited the words of an
oath, as a reporter or historian, without a real
or professed intent of swearing. Reputatively he
did not swear, 1. Who spake the words of an
oath in his sleep, or in a deliration, distraction, madness,
or such prevalent melancholy as mastereth
reason; when a man is not <i>compos mentis</i>, his act is
not <i>actus humanus</i>. (2.) When a man's hand is
forcibly moved by another against his will to subscribe
the words of an oath or covenant; for if it be
totally involuntary it is not a moral act. But words
cannot be forced; for he that sweareth to save his
life, doth do it voluntarily to save his life. The will
may be moved by fear, but not forced. Yet the person
that wrongfully frighteneth another into consent,
or to swear, hath no right to any benefit which he
thought to get by force or fraud; and so <i>in foro civili</i>
such promises, or covenants, or oaths may <i>quoad
effectum</i> be reputatively null; and he that by putting
his sword to another man's breast doth compel him
to swear or subscribe and seal a deed of gift, may be
judged to have no right to it, but to be punishable
for the force; but though this covenant or promise
be null <i>in foro humano</i>, because the person cannot
acquire a right by violence, yet the oath is not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">{576}</a></span>
nullity before God; for when God is made a party,
he hath a right which is inviolable; and when he
is appealed to or made a witness, his name must not
be taken in vain. 3. It is a nullity reputatively
when the person is naturally incapable of self-obligation,
as in infancy, when reason is not come to
so much maturity as to be naturally capable of such
a work; I say naturally incapable, for the reasons
following.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXVI. We must distinguish between a natural
incapacity of vowing or swearing at all, and an
incapacity of doing it lawfully; and between a true
nullity, and when the oath is only <i>quasi nullum</i>, or
as null <i>quoad effectum</i>, or such as I must not keep.
There are many real oaths and vows which must
not be kept, and so far are <i>quasi nulla</i> as to the
effecting of the thing vowed; but they are not
simply null; for they have the effect of making the
man a sinner and perjured. They are sinful vows,
and therefore vows. A natural incapacity proveth it
no vow at all; but if I am naturally capable, and
only forbidden, (by God or man,) this maketh it not
no vow, but a sinful vow, of which some must be
kept and some must not.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cases in which a vow must not be kept.</div>

<p>In these following cases a real
vow is <i>quasi nullum</i>, or must not be
kept.</p>

<p>1. In case the thing vowed (all things considered)
be a thing which God hath forbidden to be done;
that is, in case it be a thing in itself evil; but if the
thing in itself be a duty, though there be some inseparable
sins which we shall be guilty of in the performance,
we must not therefore leave the duty itself
undone which we have vowed: as if I vow to praise
God, and yet am sure that I cannot praise him without
a sinful defect of that love and delight in him
which is due, I must not therefore forbear to praise
him; else we must cast off all other duty, because
we cannot do it without some sin. But yet, though
in case of unwilling infirmity, we must thus do the
duty though we are sure to sin in it, yet in case of
any chosen, voluntary sin, which we have an immediate
power to avoid, we must rather forbear the
duty itself (vowed or not vowed) than commit such
a sin; as if I vow to preach the gospel, and am
forcibly hindered unless I would voluntarily tell one
lie, or commit one sin wilfully for this liberty; I
ought rather never to preach the gospel; nor is it
then a duty, but become morally impossible to me;
as if in France or Spain I may not preach unless I
would take Pope Pius's Trent confession or oath.
Nay, if those very defects of love, and wandering
thoughts, which now inseparably cleave to my best
performances, were morally and immediately in my
power, and I could avoid them, I ought not electively
and by consent to commit them, for any liberty
of duty, but rather to forbear the duty itself as no
duty to me when it cometh upon such conditions;
for then it is supposed that I could serve God better
without that duty, because I could love him more, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Yet here is observable a great deal of difference
between omissions and commissions. A man may
never commit a sin that good may come by it, though
he vowed the good; but a man may ofttimes omit
that which else would have been his duty, to do
some good which he hath vowed; for negative commands
bind <i>semper et ad semper</i>; but the affirmative
do not (at least as to outward duty); therefore in
case of necessity a man may himself consent to the
present omission of some good, for the escaping of
greater, unavoidable omissions another time, or for
the performing of a vow or greater duty which is to
be preferred.</p>

<p>2. A vow is not to be kept, when the matter of it
is unjust and injurious to another (unless you have
his consent): as if you vow to give away another
man's lands or goods, or to do him wrong by word
or deed; or if you vow to forbear to pay him his
due, or to do that which you owe him: as if a servant
vow to forbear his master's work (unless it be
so small an injury as he can otherwise repair); or
a husband, or wife, or parents, or children, or prince,
or subjects should vow to deny their necessary duties
to each other. Here man's right together with
God's law doth make it unjust to perform such vows.</p>

<p>3. A vow is as null or not to be kept, when the
matter is something that is morally or civilly out of
our power to do: as if a servant, or a child, or subject
vow to do a thing, which he cannot do lawfully
without the consent of his superior: this vow is not
simply null, for it is a sinful vow (unless it was conditional).
Every rational creature is so far <i>sui juris</i>,
as that his soul being immediately subject to God,
he is capable of obliging himself to God; and so his
vow is a real sinful vow, when he is not so far <i>sui
juris</i> as to be capable of a lawful vowing, or doing
the thing which he voweth. Such a one is bound
to endeavour to get his superior's consent, but not
without it to perform his vow; no, though the thing
in itself be lawful. For God having antecedently
bound me to obey my superiors in all lawful things,
I cannot disoblige myself by my own vows.</p>

<p>Yet here are very great difficulties in this case,
which causeth difference among the learnedest,
pious casuists. 1. If a governor have beforehand
made a law for that which I vow against, it is supposed
by many that my vow is not to be kept, (the
thing being not against the law of God,) because
the first obligation holdeth. 2. Yet some think that
magistrates' penal laws binding but <i>aut ad obedientiam
aut ad pœnam</i>, to obedience or punishment, I
am therefore obliged in indifferent things to bear his
penalty, and to keep my vow.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_76" id="Ref_76" href="#Foot_76">[76]</a></span>
3. But if I first
make an absolute vow in a thing indifferent, (as to
drink no wine, or to wear no silks, &amp;c.) and the
magistrate afterwards command it me, some think I
am bound to keep my vow; because though I must
obey the magistrate in all things lawful, yet my vow
hath made this particular thing to be to me unlawful,
before the magistrate made it a duty. 4. Though
others think that even in this case the general obligation
to obey my superiors preventeth my obliging
myself to any particular which they may forbid in
case I had not vowed it, or against any particular
which they may command. 5. Others distinguish
of things lawful or indifferent, and say that some
of them are such as become accidentally so useful
or needful to the common good, the end of government,
that it is fit the magistrate make a law for it,
and the breaking of that law will be so hurtful, that
my vow cannot bind me to it, as being now no indifferent
thing; but other indifferent things they
say belong not to the magistrate to determine of (as
what I shall eat or drink, whether I shall marry or
not, what trade I shall be of, how each artificer,
tradesman, or professor of arts and sciences shall do
the business of his profession, &amp;c.) And here the
magistrate they think cannot bind them against their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">{577}</a></span>
vows, because their power of themselves in such
private cases is greater than his power over them
in those cases. All these I leave as so many questions
unfit for me to resolve in the midst of the contentions
of the learned. The great reasons that
move on both sides you may easily discern. 1. Those
that think an oath in lawful things, obligeth not
contrary to the magistrate's antecedent or subsequent
command, are moved by this reason, That else subjects
and children might by their vows exempt themselves
from obedience, and null God's command of
obeying our superiors. 2. Those that think a vow is
obligatory against a magistrate's command, are moved
by this reason, Because else, say they, a magistrate
may at his pleasure dispense with all vows, except
in things commanded before by God: for he may
come after and cross our vows by his commands,
which, against the pope's pretensions, protestants
have denied to be in the power of any mortal man.
And God, say they, hath the first right, which none
can take away. I must not be forward in determining
where rulers are concerned; only to those that
may and must determine it, I add these further materials
to be considered of.</p>

<p>1. It is most necessary to the decision of this
case, to understand how far the inferior that voweth
was <i>sui juris</i>, and had the power of himself when he
made the vow, as to the making of it, and how far
he is <i>sui juris</i> as to the act which he hath vowed;
and to that end to know, in a case where there is
some power over his act, both in his superior and in
himself, whether his own power, or his superior's, as
to that act, be the greater.</p>

<p>2. It is therefore needful to distinguish much between
those acts that are of private use and signification
only, and those that (antecedently to the ruler's
command) are of public use and nature, or such as
the ruler is as much concerned in as the inferior.</p>

<p>3. It is needful to understand the true intent and
sense of the command of our superior; whether it
be really his intent to bind inferiors to break their
vows, or whether they intend only to bind those that
are not so entangled and pre-engaged by a vow, with
a tacit exception of those that are.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span>
And what is most
just must be presumed, unless the contrary be plain.</p>

<p>4. It must be discerned whether the commands of
superiors intend any further penalty than that which
is affixed in their laws: as in our penal laws about
using bows and arrows, and about fishing, hunting,
&amp;c.; whether it be intended that the offender be
guilty of damnation, or only that the threatened
temporal penalty do satisfy the law; and whether
God bind us to any further penalty than the superior
intendeth.</p>

<p>5. The end of the laws of men must be distinguished
from the words; and a great difference must be
put between those forbidden acts that do no further
harm than barely to cross the letter of the law, or
will of a superior, and those that cross the just end
of the command or law; and that either more or
less, as it is more or less hurtful to others, or against
the common good: for then the matter will become
sinful in itself.</p>

<p>6. Whether perjury, or the unwilling violation of
human laws, be the greater sin, and which in a
doubtful case should be most feared and avoided, it
is easy to discern.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXVII. A vow may be consequently made
null or void, 1. By cessation of the matter, or any
thing essential to it, (of which before,) or by a dispensation
or dissolution of it by God to whom we
are obliged. No doubt it is in God's power to disoblige
a man from his vow; but how he ever doth
such a thing is all the doubt: extraordinary revelations
being ceased, there is this way yet ordinary,
viz. by bringing the matter which I vowed to do,
under some prohibition of a general law, by the
changes of his providence.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXVIII. As to the power of man to dispense
with oaths and vows, there is a great and most remarkable
difference between those oaths and vows
where man is the only party that we are primarily
bound to, and God is only appealed to as witness or
judge, as to the keeping of my word to man; and
those oaths or vows where God is also made (either
only or conjunct with man) the party to whom I
primarily oblige myself. For in the first case man
can dispense with my oath or vow, by remitting his
own right, and releasing me from my promise; but
in the second case no created power can do it. As
e.&nbsp;g. if I promise to pay a man a sum of money, or
to do him service, and swear that I will perform it
faithfully; if upon some after bargain or consideration
he release me of that promise, God releaseth
me also, as the witnesses and judge have nothing
against a man, whom the creditor hath discharged.
But if I swear or vow that I will amend my life, or
reform my family of some great abuse, or that I will
give so much to the poor, or that I will give up myself
to the work of the gospel, or that I will never marry,
or never drink wine, or never consent to popery or
error, &amp;c.; no man can dispense with my vow, nor
directly disoblige me in any such case; because no
man can give away God's right: all that man can
do in any such case is, to become an occasion of
God's disobliging me: if he can so change the case,
or my condition, as to bring me under some law of
God, which commandeth me the contrary to my
vow, then God disobligeth me, or maketh it unlawful
to keep that vow. And here because a vow is
commonly taken for such a promise to God, in which
we directly bind ourselves to him, therefore we say,
that a vow (thus strictly taken) cannot be dispensed
with by man; though in the sense aforesaid, an oath
sometimes may.</p>

<p>The papists deal most perversely in this point of
dispensing with oaths and vows; for they give that
power to the pope over all the christian world, who
is a usurper, and none of our governor, which they
deny to princes and parents that are our undoubted
governors: the pope may disoblige vassals from
their oaths of allegiance to their princes, (as the
council of Lateran before cited,) but no king or parent
may disoblige a man from his oath to the pope:
nay, if a child vow a monastical life, and depart
from his parents, they allow not the parents to disoblige
him.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXIX. In the determining of controversies
about the obligation of oaths and vows, it is safest
to mark what Scripture saith, and not to presume,
upon uncertain pretence of reason, to release ourselves,
where we are not sure that God releaseth us.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXX. That observable chapter, Numb. xxx.
about dispensations, hath many things in it that are
plain for the decision of divers great and usual
doubts; but many things which some do collect and
conclude as consequential or implied, are doubtful
and controverted among the most judicious expositors
and casuists.</p>

<p>1. It is certain that this chapter speaketh not of
a total nullity of vows <i>ab initio</i>, but of a relaxation,
or disannulling of them by superiors. For, 1. Bare
silence (which is no efficient cause) doth prove them
to be in force. 2. It is not said, She is bound, or
not bound; but, Her vow and bond shall stand, ver.
4, 7, 9, 11: or, shall not stand, ver. 5, 12: and, He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">{578}</a></span>
shall make it of none effect, ver. 8. The Hebrew,
ver. 5, signifieth, <i>Quia annihilavit pater ejus illud</i>.
And ver. 8, <i>Et si in die audire virum ejus, annihilaverit
illud, et infregerit vitam ejus</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span>&mdash;3.
It is expressly said, that she had bound her soul before
the dissolution. 4. It is said, The Lord shall
forgive her, ver. 5, 8, 12, which signifieth a relaxation
of a former bond. Or at the most, the parent's
silence is a confirmation, and his disowning it hindereth
only the confirmation. So the Chaldee paraphrase;
the Samaritan and Arabic, <i>Non erunt confirmata</i>;
the Syriac, <i>Rata vel irrita erunt</i>.</p>

<p>2. It is certain that a father hath the power of relaxation
here mentioned as to an unmarried daughter,
in her youth living in his house, and a husband
over his wife; for it is the express words of the text.</p>

<p>3. It is certain that this power extendeth to vows
about all things in which the inferior is not <i>sui juris</i>,
but is under the superior's care and oversight, and
cannot perform it (in case there had been no vow)
without the superior's consent.</p>

<p>4. It is certain that it extendeth not only to matters
concerning the governors themselves, but concerning
vows to God, as they are good or hurtful to
the inferiors.</p>

<p>5. It is certain that there are some vows so necessary
and clearly for the inferior's good, that in them
he is <i>sui juris</i>, and no superior can suspend his vows:
as to have the Lord for his God; and not to commit
idolatry, murder, theft, &amp;c. No superior can disoblige
us here; for the power of superiors is only
for the inferior's indemnity and good.</p>

<p>6. It is certain that the superior's recall must be
speedy or in time, before silence can signify consent,
and make a confirmation of the vow.</p>

<p>7. It is certain that if the superior have once ratified
it by silence or consent, he cannot afterwards
disannul it.</p>

<p>8. It is agreed, that if he awhile dissent and disannul
it, and afterwards both inferior and superior
consent again, that it remaineth ratified.</p>

<p>9. It is agreed that the superior that can discharge
the vow of the inferior, cannot release himself
from his own vows. If the pope could release all
men, who shall release him?</p>

<p>But in these points following there is no such
certainty or agreement of judgments, because the
text seemeth silent about them, and men conjecture
variously as they are prepared. 1. It is uncertain
whether any but women may be released by virtue
of this text: 1. Because the text expressly distinguishing
between a man and a woman doth first say,
<i>Si vir</i>&mdash;&mdash;If a man vow a vow unto the Lord, or
swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall
not break his word; he shall do according to all that
proceedeth out of his mouth. And 2. Because
women are only instanced in, when Scripture usually
speaketh of them in the masculine gender, when it
includeth both sexes, or extendeth it to both. 3.
And in the recapitulation in the end, it is said by
way of recital of the contents, ver. 16, "These are
the statutes which the Lord commanded Moses between
a man and his wife; between the father and
his daughter&mdash;in her youth in her father's house:"
as if he would caution us against extending it any
further. And though many good expositors think
that it extendeth equally to sons as to daughters, in
their minority, because there is a parity of reason,
yet this is an uncertain conjecture: 1. Because God
seemeth by the expression to bound the sense. 2.
Because God acquainteth not man with all the reasons
of his laws. 3. Because there may be special
reasons for an indulgence to the weaker sex in such
a weighty case. And though still there is a probability
it may extend to sons, it is good keeping to
certainties in matters of such dreadful importance as
oaths and vows to God.</p>

<p>2. It is uncertain whether this power of disannulling
vows do belong also to other superiors,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_79" id="Ref_79" href="#Foot_79">[79]</a></span>
to
princes, to inferior magistrates, to pastors, masters,
to commanders, as to their soldiers, as well as to
parents and husbands. Some think it doth, because
there is, say they, a parity of reason. Others think
it is dangerous disannulling oaths and vows upon
pretences of parity of reason, when it is uncertain
whether we know all God's reasons: and they think
there is not a parity, and that it extendeth not to
others. 1. Because parents and husbands are so
emphatically named in the contents in the end, ver.
16. 2. Because it had been as easy to God to name
the rest. 3. Because there is no instance in Scripture
of the exercise of such a power, when there was
much occasion for it. 4. Because else vows signify
no more in a kingdom than the king please, and in an
army than the general and officers please, and
among servants than the master please; which is
thought a dangerous doctrine. 5. Because there will
be an utter uncertainty when a vow bindeth and
when it doth not to almost all the people in the
world; for one superior may contradict it, and another
or a hundred may be silent: the king and most
of the magistrates through distance will be silent,
when a master, or a justice, or a captain that is at
hand may disannul it: one officer may be for it, and
another against it; a master or a pastor may be for
it, and the magistrate against it: and so perjury will
become the most controverted sin, and a matter of
jest. 6. Because public magistrates, and commanders,
and pastors, have not the near and natural interest in
their inferiors as parents and husbands have in their
children and wives; and therefore parents have not
only a restraining power, (as husbands here also
have,) but also a disposing power of the relation of
their infant children, and may enter them in baptism
into the vow and covenant of christianity, the will
and act of the parents standing for the child's till
he come to age; but if you say that, upon a parity of
reason, all princes, and rulers, and pastors may do
so with all that are their inferiors, it will seem incredible
to most christians. 7. Because public magistrates
are justly supposed to be so distant from
almost all their individual subjects, as not to be
capable of so speedy a disowning their personal
vows. Whatever this text doth, it is certain that
other texts enough forbid covenants and combinations
against the persons, or power, or rights of our
governors, and not only against them, but without
them, in cases where our place and calling alloweth
us not to act without them. But it is certain that
God, who commanded all Israel to be entered successively
into the covenant of circumcision with him,
would not have held them guiltless for refusing that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">{579}</a></span>
covenant, if the prince had been against it. And few
divines think that a subject, or soldier, or servant,
that hath vowed to forbear wine, or feasting, or marriage,
is discharged, if his prince, or captain, or masters
be against it. Jonathan and David were under
an oath of friendship, (called the Lord's oath, 2&nbsp;Sam.
xxi. 7). Saul as a parent could not discharge Jonathan,
as being a man at full age. Quære whether
Saul as a king being against it, did null the oath to
David and Jonathan? No; the Scripture showeth the
contrary. 8. Because else that benefit which God
extendeth only to a weaker sort, would extend to
any, the wisest and most learned persons through
the world, whose vows to God, even for the afflicting
of their own souls, may be nulled by the king or
other superiors. Many such reasons are urged in
this case.</p>

<p>3. It is uncertain whether this chapter extend to
assertory or testimonial oaths (if not certain that it
doth not): it speaketh but of binding their souls
to God, which is to offer or do something which
by error may prove prejudicial to them. But if a
parent or husband (much more a king or general)
might nullify all the testimonial oaths of their inferiors
that are given in judgment, or discharge all
their subjects from the guilt of all the lies or false
oaths which they shall take, it would make a great
change in the morality of the world.</p>

<p>4. It is not past all controversy how far this law
is yet in force: seeing the Mosaical law as such is
abrogated; this can be now no further in force than
as it is the law of nature, or some way confirmed or
revived by Christ. The equity seemeth to be natural.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXI. It is certain that whoever this power
of disannulling vows belongeth to, and to whomsoever
it may be given, that it extendeth not to discharge
us from the promise or vow of that which is antecedently
our necessary duty, by the law of God. Else
they should dispense with the law of God, when
none but the lawgiver can relax or dispense with his
laws (unless it be one superior to the lawgiver):
therefore none can dispense with the laws of God.
But I speak this but of a duty necessary also as a
means to our salvation, or the good of others, or the
honouring of God: for otherwise as to some smaller
things, the duty may be such as man cannot dispense
with, and yet a vow to do that duty may be unnecessary
and sinful: as if I swear to keep all the law of
God, and never to sin, or never to think a sinful
thought; to do this is good, but to vow it is bad, because
I may foreknow that I shall break it.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXII. In some cases a vow may oblige
you against that which would have been your duty
if you had not vowed, and to do that which would
else have been your sin: viz. if it be such a thing as
is sin or duty but by some lesser accident, which the
accident of a vow may preponderate or prevail
against. As if you swear to give a penny to a wandering
beggar, or to one that needeth it not, which
by all circumstances would have been an unlawful
misemploying of that which should have been better
used; yet it seemeth to me your duty to do it when
you have moved it. To cast away a cup of drink is
a sin, if it be causelessly; but if you vow to do it, it
is hard to say that a man should rather be perjured
than cast away a cup of drink, or a penny, or a pin.
The Jesuits think it lawful to exercise the obedience
of their novices by bidding them sometimes cast a
cup of wine into the sink, or do some such action
which causelessly done were sin: and shall not a
vow require it more strongly? Suppose it would be
your duty to pray or read at such or such an hour of
the day (as being fittest to your body and occasions);
yet if you have (foolishly) vowed against it, it seemeth
to me to be your duty to put it off till another
time. For perjury is too great a thing to be yielded
to on every such small occasion. Dr. Sanderson<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_80" id="Ref_80" href="#Foot_80">[80]</a></span>
<i>ubi supra</i> giveth this instance: If there be a law that
no citizen elected to it shall refuse the office of a
prætor; and he that doth refuse it shall be fined:
Caius sweareth that he will not bear the office: his
oath is unlawful, (and disobedience would have been
his sin if he were free,) yet it seems he is bound to
pay his fine, and disobey the precept of the law,
rather than break his vow.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXIII. There are so great a number of
sins and duties that are such by accidents and circumstantial
alterations, and some of these greater
and some less, that it is a matter of exceeding great
difficulty in morality to discern when they are indeed
sins and duties and when not, which must be by discerning
the preponderancy of accidents; and therefore
it must be exceeding difficult to discern when a
vow shall weigh down any of these accidents, and
when not.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXIV. The exceeding difficulty and frequency
of such cases maketh it necessary to those
that have such entanglements of vows, to have a very
wise and faithful counsellor to help them better to
resolve their particular cases, upon the knowledge of
every circumstance, than any book or general rules
can do, or any that are not so perfectly acquainted
with the case. And oh what great ability is necessary
in divines that are employed in such works!</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXV. Thus also the case must be resolved
whether an oath bind that hindereth a greater good
which I might do if I had not taken it. In some
cases it may bind: as if I swear to acquaint none
with some excellent medicine which I could not
have known myself unless I had so sworn; or in
case that the breaking of the oath will do more hurt
to me or others than the good comes to which I omit:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_81" id="Ref_81" href="#Foot_81">[81]</a></span>
or in case, all things considered, the doing of that
good <i>hic et nunc</i> is not my duty: see Dr. Sanderson
of the difficulties here also, p. 78, 79.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXVI. No personal hurt or temporal loss
is any sufficient cause for the violation of an oath.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_82" id="Ref_82" href="#Foot_82">[82]</a></span>
He that taketh a false oath, or breaketh a promissory
oath, for the saving of his life, or a thousand
men's lives, or for lands or riches, or crowns and
kingdoms, hath no considerable excuse for his perfidiousness
and perjury, all temporal things being
such inconsiderable trifles in comparison of the will
and pleasure of God, and life everlasting: that which
will not justify a lie, will much less justify perjury.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_83" id="Ref_83" href="#Foot_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXVII. If the matter of an oath prove
only a temptation to sin, and not sin itself, it must
be kept: but with the greater vigilancy and resolution.
As if a man have married a froward wife that
will be a temptation to him all his life, he is not
disobliged from her.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXVIII. If the matter of an oath be such
as maketh me directly the tempter of myself or
others, it is a sin, and not to be kept, unless some
greater good preponderate that evil. For though it
be no sin to be tempted, yet it is a sin to tempt:
though it be no sin to tempt by a necessary trial, (as
a master may lay money before a suspected servant
to try whether he be a thief,) nor any sin to tempt
accidentally by the performance of a duty (as a holy
life doth accidentally tempt a malignant person to
hatred and persecution); yet it is a sin to be directly
and needlessly a tempter of ourselves or others unto
sin; and therefore he that voweth it must not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">{580}</a></span>
perform it. As if you had vowed to persuade
any to unchastity, intemperance, error, rebellion,
&amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of accidental evil or temptation vowed.</div>

<p><i>Rule</i> XXXIX. If the matter of an
oath be such as accidentally layeth
so strong a temptation before men,
(especially before a multitude,) as that we may foresee
it is exceeding likely to draw them into sin, when
there is no greater good to preponderate the evil of
such a temptation, it is a sin to do that thing, though
in performance of a vow. When actions are good
or evil only by accident, then accidents must be put
in the balance against each other, and the weightiest
must preponderate. As in matter of temporal commodity
or discommodity, it is lawful to do that action
which accidentally bringeth a smaller hurt to
one man, if it bring a greater good to many; or
which hurteth a private person to the great good of
the commonwealth; but it is not lawful to do that
which clearly tendeth (though but by accident) to do
more hurt than good: as to sell powder and arms,
when we foresee it will be used against the king and
kingdom; or to sell ratsbane, when you foresee it is
like to be used to poison men. Much more should
the salvation of many or one be preferred before our
temporal commodity; and therefore for a lesser
good, we may not tempt men to evil, though but accidentally:
as he that liveth where there is but little
need of taverns or ale-houses, and the common use
of them is for drunkenness, it is unlawful for him
there to sell ale or wine, unless he can keep men
from being drunk with it (as if they take it home
with them, or be unruly, he cannot). For thus to be
a foreknowing tempter and occasion, unnecessarily,
is to be a moral cause. Two things will warrant a
man to do that which by accident tempteth or occasioneth
other men to sin: one is a command of
God, when it is a duty which we do: the other is a
greater good to be attained by the action, which
cannot be attained in a less dangerous way. As in
a country where there is so great a necessity of
ale-houses and taverns that the good that is done by
them is greater than the hurt is like to be, though
some will be drunk; it is lawful to use these trades,
though some be hurt by it. It is lawful to sell flesh,
though some will be gluttonous; it is lawful to use
moderate, decent ornaments, though some vain
minds will be tempted by the sight to lust; as it is
lawful to go to sea though some be drowned. To act
a comedy, or play at a lawful game, with all those
cautions, which may secure you that the good of it
is like to be greater than the hurt, is not unlawful:
but to set up a common play-house, or gaming-house,
where we may foresee that the mischief will be far
greater than the good, (though the acts were lawful
in themselves,) this is but to play the devil's part,
in laying snares for souls: men are not thus to be
ticed to hell and damned in sport, though but accidentally,
and though you vowed the act.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of scandal.</div>

<p><i>Rule</i> XL. Thus also must the case
of scandal be resolved:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_84" id="Ref_84" href="#Foot_84">[84]</a></span>
as scandal
signifieth an action that occasioneth another to sin,
or a stumblingblock at which we foresee he is like
to fall to the hurt of his soul, (which is the sense
that Christ and his apostles usually take it in,) so it
is the same case with this last handled, and needs
no other resolution: but as scandal signifieth (in the
late abusive sense) the mere displeasing of another,
or occasioning him to censure you for a sinner, so
you must not break a vow to escape the censure or
displeasure of all the world. Otherwise pride would
be still producing perjury, and so two of the greatest
sins would be maintained.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XLI. Though in the question about the
obligation of an oath that is taken ignorantly, or by
deceit, there be great difficulties, yet this much
seemeth clear: 1. That he that is culpably ignorant
is more obliged by his vow or contract while he
useth all the outward form, than he that is inculpably
ignorant. 2. That though the deceit (as the
force) of him that I swear to, do forfeit his right
to what I promise him, yet my oath or vow obligeth
me to do or to give the thing, having interested God
himself in the cause. 3. That all such errors of the
essentials of an oath or vow as nullify it, (of which I
spake before,) or make the matter sinful, do infer a
nullity in the obligation (or that it must not be kept).
But no smaller error (though caused by deceit) doth
disoblige.</p>

<p>The commonest doubt is, Whether an error about
the very person that I swear to, and this caused by
his own deceit, do disoblige me? All grant that I
am obliged notwithstanding any circumstantial
error (as if I think a woman rich whom I marry,
and she prove poor; or wise and godly, and she prove
foolish or ungodly: yea, if the error be about any
integral part; as if I think she had two eyes or legs,
and she have but one): and all grant that an error
about an essential part, that is, which is essential to
the relation or thing vowed, (if inculpable at least,)
disobligeth: as if I took a man in marriage thinking
he had been a woman; or if I took a person for a
pastor, a physician, a counsellor, a pilot, that hath
no tolerable ability or skill in the essentials of any
of those professions. But whether I am bound if I
swear to Thomas thinking it was John, or if I marry
Leah thinking she is Rachel, is the great doubt.
And most casuists say I am not: and therefore I
dare not be bold to contradict them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_85" id="Ref_85" href="#Foot_85">[85]</a></span>
But I much
suspect that they fetched their decision from the
lawyers; who truly say, that <i>in foro civili</i> it inferreth
no obligation: but whether it do not oblige me ethically,
and <i>in foro conscientiæ et cœli</i>, I much doubt,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_86" id="Ref_86" href="#Foot_86">[86]</a></span>
1. Because it seemeth the very case of Joshua and
the Israelites, who by the guile of the Gibeonites
were deceived into an <i>error personarum</i>, taking them
to be other persons than they were: and yet that
this oath was obligatory, saith Dr. Sanderson, is apparent,
(1.) In the text itself, Josh. ix. 19. (2.) In
the miracle wrought for that victory which Joshua
obtained in defending the Gibeonites when the sun
stood still, Josh. x. 8, 13. (3.) In the severe revenge
that was taken on the lives of Saul's posterity for
offering to violate it, 2&nbsp;Sam. xxi. 2. 2. And this
seemeth to be the very case of Jacob, who took not
himself disobliged from Leah notwithstanding the
mistake of the person through deceit. And though
the <i>concubitus</i> was added to the contract, that obliged
most as it was the perfecting of the contract, which
an oath doth as strongly. 3. And the nature of the
thing doth confirm my doubt; because when I see
the person before me there is the <i>individuum determinatum</i>,
in the <i>hæc homo</i>, and so all that is essential
to my vow is included in it: if I mistake the name, or
the quality, or birth, or relations of the person, yet
my covenant is with this determinate person that is
present, though I be induced to it by a false supposition
that she is another. But this I leave to the
discussion of the judicious.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XLII. The question also is weighty and of
frequent use, if a man vow a thing as a duty in
obedience to God and conscience, which he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">{581}</a></span>
not have done if he had taken it to be no duty, and
if he afterwards find that it was no duty, is he obliged
to keep this vow? And the true answer is, that the
discovery of his error doth only discover the nullity
of his obligation to make that vow, and to do the
thing antecedently to the vow; but if the thing be
lawful, he is bound to it by his vow notwithstanding
the mistake which induced him to make it.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XLIII. Vows about trifles (not unlawful)
must be kept though they are sinfully made.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_87" id="Ref_87" href="#Foot_87">[87]</a></span>
As if
you vow to take up a straw, or to forbear such a bit or
sort of meat, or garment, &amp;c. But to make such is a
great profanation of God's name, and a taking it in
vain as common swearers do.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XLIV. A general oath, though taken upon a
particular occasion, must be generally or strictly interpreted
(unless there be special reasons for a restraint,
from the matter, end, or other evidence). As
if you are afraid that your son should marry such a
woman, and therefore swear him not to marry without
your consent; he is bound thereby neither to
marry that woman nor any other. Or if your servant
haunt one particular ale-house, and you make
him forswear all houses in general, he must avoid all
other. So Dr. Sanderson instanceth in the oath of
supremacy, p. 195.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XLV. He that voweth absolutely or implicitly
to obey another in all things, is bound to obey
him in all lawful things, where neither God, nor
other superior or other person is injured; unless the
nature of the relation, or the ends or reasons of the
oath, or something else, infer a limitation as implied.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> XLVI. Still distinguish between the falsehood
in the words as disagreeing to the thing sworn,
and the falsehood of them as disagreeing from the
swearer's mind. The former is sometimes excusable,
but the latter never.</p>

<p>There are many other questions about oaths that
belong more to the chapter of contracts and justice
between man and man; and thither I refer them.</p>

Plutarch. Quest. Roman. 44. Why may not priests
swear? Resp. Is it because an oath put to free-born men,
is as it were the rack and torture offered them? For certain
it is that the soul as well as the body of the priest, ought to
continue free, and not to be forced by any torture. Or that
we must not distrust them in small matters, who are to be
believed in great and divine things? Or because the peril
of perjury would reach in common to the whole commonwealth,
if a wicked, and ungodly, and forsworn person should
have the charge and superintendency of the prayers, vows,
and sacrifices made in behalf of the city? Page 866.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS TO THE PEOPLE CONCERNING THEIR INTERNAL AND PRIVATE DUTY TO
THEIR PASTORS, AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR MINISTERIAL OFFICE AND
GIFTS.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
people's internal and private duty to their pastors
(which I may treat of without an appearance of
encroachment upon the work of the canons, rubrics,
and diocesans) I shall open to you in these directions
following.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Understand first the true ground, and
nature, and reasons of the ministerial office, or else
you will not understand the grounds, and nature, and
reasons of your duty to them. The nature and
works of the ministerial office I have so plainly
opened already that I shall refer you to it to avoid
repetition.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_88" id="Ref_88" href="#Foot_88">[88]</a></span>
Here are two sorts of reasons to be
given you: 1. The reasons of the necessity of the
ministerial work. 2. Why certain persons must be
separated to this work, and it must not be left to all
in common.</p>

<p>The necessity of the work itself appeareth in the
very nature of it, and enumeration of the parts of it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_89" id="Ref_89" href="#Foot_89">[89]</a></span>
Two sorts of ministers Christ hath made use of for
his church: the first sort was for the revelation of
some new law or doctrine, to be the church's
rule of faith or life; and these were to prove their
authority and credibility by some divine attestation,
which was especially by miracles; and so Moses revealed
the law to the Jews, and (Christ and) the
apostles revealed the gospel. The second sort of
ministers are appointed to guide the church to salvation
by opening and applying the rule thus already
sealed and delivered: and these, as they are to bring
no new revelations or doctrines of faith, or rule of
life, so they need not bring any miracle to prove
their call or authority to the church; for they have
no power to deliver any new doctrine or gospel to
the church, but only that which is confirmed by
miracles already. And it is impudence to demand
that the same gospel be proved by new miracles by
every minister that shall expound or preach it: that
would make miracles to be no miracles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The work of the ministry.</div>

<p>The work of the ordinary ministry
(such as the priests and teachers
were under the law, and ordinary
pastors and teachers are under the gospel) being
only to gather and govern the churches, their work
lay in explaining and applying the word of God, and
delivering his sacraments, and now containeth these
particulars following: 1. To preach the gospel for
the conversion of the unbelieving and ungodly world.
And that is done, partly by expounding the words by
a translation into a tongue which the hearers or
readers understand; and partly by opening the sense
and matter.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_90" id="Ref_90" href="#Foot_90">[90]</a></span>
2. In this they are not only teachers,
but messengers sent from God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, to charge, and command, and entreat
men in his name to repent and believe, and be reconciled
to God; and in his name to offer them a sealed
pardon of all their sins, and title to eternal life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_91" id="Ref_91" href="#Foot_91">[91]</a></span>
3. Those that become the disciples of Christ, they
are (as his stewards) to receive into his house, as
fellow-citizens of the saints, and of the household of
God; and as his commissioned officers, to solemnize
by baptism their entrance into the holy covenant, and
to receive their engagement to God, and to be the
messengers of God's engagement unto them, and by
investiture to deliver them by that sacrament the
pardon of all their sin, and their title by adoption to
eternal life; as a house is delivered by the delivery
of a key; or land, by a twig and turf; or knighthood,
by a sword or garter, &amp;c. 4. These ministers are to
gather these converts into solemn assemblies and
ordered churches, for their solemn worshipping of
God, and mutual edification, communion, and safe
proceeding in their christian course.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_92" id="Ref_92" href="#Foot_92">[92]</a></span>
5. They are
to be the stated teachers of the assemblies, by expounding
and applying that word which is fit to build
them up. 6. They are to be the guides of the congregation
in public worship, and to stand between
them and Christ in things pertaining to God, as subservient
to Christ in his priestly office; and so both
for the people, and also in their names, to put up the
public prayers and praises of the church to God.
7. It is their duty to administer to them, as in the
name and stead of Christ, his body and blood as
broken and shed for them, and so in the frequent renewals
of the holy covenants, to subserve Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">{582}</a></span>
especially in his priestly office, to offer and deliver
Christ and his benefits to them, and to be their agent
in offering themselves to God. 8. They are appointed
to oversee and govern the church, in the public
ordering of the solemn worship of God, and in rebuking
any that are there disorderly, and seeing that
all things be done to edification.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_93" id="Ref_93" href="#Foot_93">[93]</a></span>
9. They are appointed
as teachers for every particular member of the
church to have private and personal recourse to, (as
far as may be,) for the resolving of their weighty
doubts, and instruction in cases of difficulty and necessity,
and for the settling of their peace and comfort.
10. They are appointed as physicians under
Christ, to watch over all the individual members of
their charge, and take care that they be not infected
with heresy, or corrupted by vice; and to admonish
the offenders, and reduce them into the way of truth
and holiness, and if they continue impenitent after
public admonition, to reject them from the communion
of the church, and command the church to avoid
them. 11. They are as to bind over the impenitent
to answer their contumacy at the bar of Christ, so
to absolve the penitent, and comfort them, and require
the church to re-admit them to their communion.
12. They are appointed as stewards in the
household of Christ, to have a tender care of the
very bodily welfare of their flocks, so as to endeavour
the supplying of their wants, and stirring up the
rich to relieve the poor, and faithfully (by themselves
or the deacons) to distribute what is intrusted with
them for that use. 13. They are especially to visit
the sick, and when they are sent for, to pray for them
and with them, and to instruct them in their special
preparations for death, and confirm them against
those last assaults. 14. They are appointed to be
the public champions of the truth, to defend it against
all heretical and profane opposers, and thereby to
preserve the flock from being seduced. 15. They
are appointed to be (under Christ the Head) the
nerves and ligaments of the several churches, by
which they are kept not only in vigour by communication
of nutriment, but also in concord, and such
communion as they are capable of, by the correspondencies,
and consultations, and councils of their
pastors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_94" id="Ref_94" href="#Foot_94">[94]</a></span>
All these are the distinct and special uses
to which Christ hath appointed the office of the sacred
ministry; which having but named to you, I
need to say no more to show you the excellency, and
necessity, and benefits of it.</p>

<p>Herein also the reasons are apparent, why Christ
did institute this sacred office. 1. Because it was
meet his kingdom should have officers, suited to his
work in the administration of it. 2. It was meet
that they be men like ourselves, that we can familiarly
converse with. 3. The great necessity of his
church required it, where the most are weak, and
insufficient to perform all these offices for themselves;
and cannot well subsist without the support of others.
It was meet therefore that the pastors were selected
persons, wiser, and holier, and stronger than the
people, and fit for so great and necessary a work.
4. It was requisite also to the order of the church;
for if it were like an army without officers, there
would be nothing but confusion, and neither order
nor edification.</p>

<p>By this you may also see the nature and reasons
of your obedience to your pastors: as they are not
appointed to govern you by force,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_95" id="Ref_95" href="#Foot_95">[95]</a></span>
but willingly,
"not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, not as
being lords over God's heritage, but as ensamples to
the flock," 1&nbsp;Pet. v. 1-3, so you must willingly and
cheerfully obey them in their work. As their government<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_96" id="Ref_96" href="#Foot_96">[96]</a></span>
is not by any bodily penalties or mulcts,
(for that is the magistrate's work and not theirs,)
but a government by the force of truth and love; so
your obedience of them consisteth in the loving and
thankful reception of the truth which they teach
you, and the mercies which they offer you from
Christ.</p>

<p>You see then that the reasons of your obedience
are manifold. 1. Some of them from God: he hath
sent his messengers to you, and set his officers over
you; and Christ hath told you that he that heareth
them heareth him, and he that despiseth them despiseth
him, and him that sent him, Luke x. 16:
he commandeth you to hear and obey them as his
officers. 2. From themselves: they have authority
by their commission, and they have ability in their
qualifications, which require your obedience and
improvement. 3. From yourselves. Have you reason
to obey your natural parents on whom your livelihood
in the world dependeth? Have you reason to
obey him that tendereth you a pardon from the king
when you are condemned? or that offereth you gold
or riches in your want? or that inviteth you to a
feast in a time of famine? or that offereth to defend
and save you from your enemies? Much more have
you reason to obey Christ's ministers when they call
you to repentance, and offer you pardon of sin, and
peace, and salvation, and eternal life. Did you ever
hear a man so mad or churlish, as to say to one that
offered him riches, or liberty, or life, I am not bound
to obey you; offer them to those that you have
authority over? When the office of the ministry is
as well subservient to Christ as a Saviour and Benefactor,
as to Christ as your Teacher and your King,
the very nature of their work engageth you to obey
them as you love yourselves. If you were in hell,
and Christ should send for you out, you would not
refuse to go, till the messenger had proved his
authority. And when you are the heirs of hell, condemned
by the law, and going thither, will you refuse
to turn back, and yield to the offers and commands
of grace, till you have skill enough to read
the minister's commission?</p>

<p>By this also you see, that the power of your pastors
is not absolute, nor coercive and lordly, but
ministerial.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_97" id="Ref_97" href="#Foot_97">[97]</a></span>
And though the papists make a scorn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">{583}</a></span>
of the word "minister," it is but in that pride, and
passion, and malice which maketh them speak
against their knowledge: for their pope himself calleth
himself the servant of God's servants; and Paul
saith, 1&nbsp;Cor. iv. 1, "Let a man so account of us as of
the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries
of God." 1&nbsp;Cor. iii. 5, "Who then is Paul, and who is
Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed?" 2&nbsp;Cor.
iii. 6, "Who made us able ministers of the new testament."
2&nbsp;Cor. vi. 4, "In all things approving ourselves
as the ministers of God." Even magistrates,
yea, and angels, are not too good to be called (and
used as) the ministers of God for the good of his
servants, Rom. xiii. 3, 6; "and to minister for them
who shall be heirs of salvation," Heb. i. 7, 14. Yea,
Christ himself is so called, Rom. xv. 8. And therefore
you have no more excuse for your disobedience,
than for refusing his help that would pull you out of
fire or water when you are perishing. You see
here that your pastors cannot command you what
they list, nor how they list. They have nothing to
do with the magistrate's work; nor can they usurp
the power of a master over his servants, nor command
you how to do your work and worldly business
(except in the morality of it). In the fifteen particulars
before mentioned their work and office doth
consist, and in those it is that you owe them a rational
obedience.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Know your own pastors in particular:
and know both what you owe to a minister as a
minister of Christ in common, and what you owe
him moreover as your pastor by special relation and
charge.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_98" id="Ref_98" href="#Foot_98">[98]</a></span>
When any minister of Christ delivereth
his word to you, he must be heard as a minister of
Christ, and not as a private man; but to your own
pastor you are bound in a particular relation, to an
ordinary and regular attendance upon his ministry in
all the particulars before mentioned that concern
you. Your own bishop must in a special manner be
obeyed:</p>

<p>1. As one that laboureth among you, and is over
you in the Lord, and admonisheth you, and preacheth
to you the word of God,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_99" id="Ref_99" href="#Foot_99">[99]</a></span>
watching for your souls
as one that must give account, 1&nbsp;Thess. v. 12; Heb.
xiii. 7, 17; and as one that ruleth well, and especially
that laboureth in the word and doctrine, 1&nbsp;Tim. v.
17; "teaching you publicly and from house to house,
taking heed to himself, and to all the flock over
which the Holy Ghost hath made him an overseer,
not ceasing to warn every one night and day with
tears," Acts xx. 19, 20, 24, 28, 31, 33. "Preaching
Christ, and warning every man, and teaching every
man in all wisdom, that he may present every man
perfect in Christ," Col. i. 28.</p>

<p>2. He is to be obeyed as the guide of the congregation
in the management of God's public worship.
You must seriously and reverently join with him
every Lord's day at least in the public prayers and
praises of the church, and not ordinarily go from him
to another.</p>

<p>3. You must receive from him or with him, the
sacrament of the body and blood of Christ: which
of old was administered every Lord's day, and that
only in the church where the bishop was, that is, in
every church of the faithful: for, as Ignatius most
observably saith,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_100" id="Ref_100" href="#Foot_100">[100]</a></span>
<span title="hen thusiastêrion pasê tê ekklêsia, kai heis episkopos hama tô
presbyteriô, kai tois diakonois">ἓν θυσιαστήριον πάσῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ,

ALTARE OMNI ECCLESIÆ, ET UNUS EPISCOPUS CUM PRESBYTERIO ET
DIACONIS.&mdash;IN EVERY CHURCH there is ONE ALTAR, and ONE BISHOP, WITH
THE PRESBYTERY and DEACONS.&mdash;So in his Epist. ad Magnes.
Come all as one, to the temple of God, as to one
altar, as to one Jesus Christ. And saith Tertullian,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_101" id="Ref_101" href="#Foot_101">[101]</a></span>
<i>Eucharistæ Sacramentum&mdash;nec de aliorum manu quam
præsidentium sumimus</i>: We take not the sacrament
of the eucharist from the hand of any but the president.</p>

<p>4. You must have recourse to him especially for
the resolution of your weighty doubts, in private.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_102" id="Ref_102" href="#Foot_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>5. You must hear your bishops and repent, when
in meekness and love they convince and admonish
you against your sins, and not resist the word of
God which they powerfully and patiently lay home
to your consciences, nor put them with grief to cut
you off, as impenitent in scandalous sins, from the
communion of the church.</p>

<p>6. You must, after any scandalous sin which hath
brought you under the censure of the church, go
humble yourselves by penitent confession, and crave
absolution and restoration to the communion of the
church.</p>

<p>7. Your public church alms should ordinarily be
deposited into the bishop's hands, who relieveth the
orphans and widows, and is the curator or guardian
to all absolutely that are in want, saith Ignatius to
Polycarp, cited by Dr. Hammond on 1&nbsp;Cor. xii. 28.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_103" id="Ref_103" href="#Foot_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>8. You must send for him in your sickness to pray
with you and advise you. See Dr. Hammond on
James v. 14. And on 1&nbsp;Cor. xii. 28, he saith,
Polycarp himself speaking of the elders or bishops
saith, They visit and take care of all that are sick,
not neglecting the widows, the orphans, or the poor.
And Dr. Hammond on James v. 14, showeth out of
antiquity,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_104" id="Ref_104" href="#Foot_104">[104]</a></span>
that One part of the bishop's office is set
down, that they are those that visit all the sick.
Not but that a stranger may be made use of also;
but ordinarily and especially your own bishop must
be sent for; because as you are his special charge,
and he "watcheth for your souls as one that must
give account," Heb. xiii. 17, so it is supposed that
he is better acquainted with your spiritual state and
life than others are, and therefore in less danger of
wronging you by mistake and misapplications; for
it is supposed that you have acquainted him with
your personal condition in your health, having taken
him as your ordinary counsellor for your souls, and
that he hath acquainted himself with your condition,
and confirmed you, and watched over you by name,
as Ignatius to Polycarp bishop of Smyrna saith,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_105" id="Ref_105" href="#Foot_105">[105]</a></span>
<i>Sæpe congregationes fiant: ex nomine omnes quære:
servos et ancillas ne despicias</i>, as bishop Usher's
old Latin translation hath it: Let congregations be
often held; inquire after all by name: despise not
servants and maids. The bishop took notice of every
servant and maid by name; and he had opportunity
to see whether they were in the congregation.</p>

<p>9. You must use him as your leader or champion
against all heretics, infidels, and subtle adversaries
of the truth, with whom you are unable to contend
yourselves, that your bishops may clear up and defend
the cause of Christ and righteousness, and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">{584}</a></span>
irresistible evidence, stop the mouths of all gainsayers.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_106" id="Ref_106" href="#Foot_106">[106]</a></span>
It is for your own benefit, and not for
theirs, that you are required in all these works of
their office to use them and readily obey them. And
what hurt can it do you to obey them in any of these?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Understand how it is that Christ doth
authorize and send forth his ministers, lest wolves
and deceivers should either obtrude themselves upon
you as your lawful pastors, or should alienate you
from those that God hath set over you, by puzzling
you in subtle questioning or disputing against their
call. Not only Paul's warnings, Acts xx. 30, and
2&nbsp;Tim. iii. 6, but lamentable experience, telleth us
what an eager desire there is in proud and self-conceited
men, to obtrude themselves as teachers and
pastors on the churches, to creep into houses and
lead people captive, and draw away disciples after
them, and say (and perhaps think) that others are
deceivers, and none are the true teachers indeed but
they. And the first part of the art and work of
wolves, is to separate you from your pastors, and
catch up the stragglers that are thus separated.
The malice, and slanders, and lies, and railing of
hirelings and deceivers, and all the powers of hell,
are principally poured out on the faithful pastors and
leaders of the flocks. The principal work of the
Jesuits against you, is to make you believe that your
pastors are no true pastors, but uncalled private persons,
and mere usurpers: and the reason must be,
because they have not an ordination of bishops successively
from the apostles without interruption.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_107" id="Ref_107" href="#Foot_107">[107]</a></span>
I
confess if our interruptions had been half as lamentable
as theirs, (by their schisms, and variety of
popes at once; and popes accused, or condemned by
general councils, for heretics; and their variety
of ways of electing popes, and their incapacities by
simony, usurpation, &amp;c.) I should think at least
that our ancestors had cause to have questioned the
calling of some that were then over them. But I
will help you in a few words to discern the juggling
of these deceivers, by showing you the truth concerning
the way of Christ's giving his commission to
the ministers that are truly called, and the needlessness
of the proof of an uninterrupted succession of
regular ordination, to your reception of your pastors
and their ministrations.</p>

<p>The ministerial commission is contained in, and
conveyed by, the law of Christ, which is the charter
of the church, and every true bishop or pastor hath
his power from Christ, and not at all from the efficient
conveyance of any mortal man: even as kings
have their power not from man, but from God himself;
but with this difference, that in the church
Christ hath immediately determined of the species
of church offices, but in the civil government, only
of the genus (absolutely and immediately).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_108" id="Ref_108" href="#Foot_108">[108]</a></span>
You
cannot have a plainer illustration, than by considering
how mayors, and bailiffs, and constables are annually
made in corporations: the king by his charter
saith, that every year at a certain time the free-men
or burgesses shall meet, and choose one to be their
mayor, and the steward or town-clerk shall give him
his oath, and thus or thus he shall be invested in
his place, and this shall be his power and work, and
no other. So the king by his law appointeth that
constables and churchwardens shall be chosen in
every parish. Now let our two questions be here
decided: 1. Who is it that giveth these officers their
power? 2. Whether an uninterrupted succession of
such officers through all generations since the enacting
of that law, be necessary to the validity of the
present officer's authority? To the first, It is certain
that it is the king by his law or charter that
giveth the officers their power; and that the corporations
and parishes do not give it them by electing
or investing them; yea, though the king hath
made such election and investiture to be in a sort
his instrument in the conveying it, it is but as the
opening of the door to let them in, <i>sine quo non</i>; but
it doth not make the instruments to be at all the
givers of the power, nor were they the receiving or
containing mediate causes of it. The king never
gave them the power which the officers receive,
either to use, or to give; but only makes the electors
his instruments to determine of the person that shall
receive the power immediately from the law or
charter; and the investers he maketh his instruments
of solemnizing the tradition and admission:
which if the law or charter make absolutely necessary
<i>ad esse officii</i>, it will be so; but if it make it
necessary only <i>ad melius esse</i>, or but for order and
regular admittance when no necessity hindereth it,
the necessity will be no more. And to the second
question, It is plain that the law, which is the <i>fundamentum
juris</i>, remaining still the same, if a parish
omit for divers years to choose any constable or
churchwarden, yet the next time they do choose one
according to law, the law doth authorize him, nevertheless,
though there was an interruption or vacancy
so long; and so in corporations (unless the law or
charter say the contrary): so is it in the present
case. 1. It is the established law of Christ, which
describeth the office, determineth of the degree and
kind of power, and granteth or conveyeth it, when
the person is determined of by the electors and ordainers,
though by ordination the delivery and admission
is regularly to be solemnized; which actions
are of just so much necessity as that law hath made
them, and no more. 2. And if there were never so
long an interruption or vacancy, he that afterward
entereth lawfully, so as to want nothing which the
law of Christ hath made necessary to the being of
the office, doth receive his power nevertheless immediately
from the law of Christ. And Bellarmine
himself saith, that it is not necessary to the people,
and to the validity of sacraments and offices to them,
to know that their pastors be truly called or ordained:
and if it be not necessary to the validity of
sacraments, it is not necessary to the validity of ordination.
And W. Johnson<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_109" id="Ref_109" href="#Foot_109">[109]</a></span>
confesseth to me that
consecration is not absolutely necessary <i>ad esse
officii</i> to the pope himself: no, nor any one sort of
electors in his election, p. 133. And in his Repl.
Term. Expl. p. 45, he saith, Neither papal nor episcopal
jurisdiction (as all the learned know) depends
of episcopal or papal ordination: nor was there ever
interruptions of successions in episcopal jurisdiction
in any see, for want of that alone, that is necessary
for consecrating others validly, and not for jurisdiction
over them. You see then how little sincerity
is in these men's disputations, when they would persuade
you to reject your lawful pastors as no true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">{585}</a></span>
ministers of Christ, for want of their ordination or
succession.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Though the sacraments and other ministerial
offices are valid, when a minister is qualified
(in his abilities and call) but with so much as is
essential to the office, though he be defective in degree
of parts and faithfulness, and have personal
faults which prove his own destruction; yet so great
is the difference between a holy, heavenly, learned,
judicious, experienced, skilful, zealous, laborious,
faithful minister, and an ignorant, ungodly, idle, unskilful
one, and so highly should every wise man
value the best means and advantages to his eternal
happiness, that he should use all lawful means in his
power to enjoy and live under such an able, godly,
powerful ministry, though he part with his worldly
wealth and pleasure to attain it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_110" id="Ref_110" href="#Foot_110">[110]</a></span>
I know no evil
must be done for the attainment of the greatest helps;
(for we cannot expect that God should bless a sinful
course, or that our sin should tend to the saving of
our souls;) and I know God can bless the weakest
means, when they are such as he appointeth us to
use; and can teach us by angels when he denieth
us the help of men: but Scripture, reason, and experience
tell us, that ordinarily he worketh morally
by means, and fitteth the means to the work which
he will do by them: and as he doth not use to light
men by a clod or stone, but by a candle, nor by a
rotten post or glow-worm so much as by a torch or
luminary; so he doth not use to work as much by
an ignorant, drunken, idle person, who despiseth the
God, the heaven, the Christ, the Spirit, the grace,
the sacred word which he preacheth, and vilifieth
both his own and other men's souls, as he doth by
an able and compassionate minister. And the soul
is of so much more worth than the body, and eternal
things than temporal, that a little commodity to the
soul in order to the securing of our salvation, must
be preferred before a great deal of worldly riches:
he that knoweth what his soul, his Saviour, and heaven
is worth, will not easily sit down contented,
under such a dark, and dull, and starving minister, as
he feeleth he can but little profit by, if better may
be had on lawful terms. He that feeleth no difference
between the ministry of these two sorts of men, it is
because he is a stranger to the work of the gospel
on the soul: and "if the gospel (in its truth, or worth,
or use) be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, the
god of this world having blinded their minds."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_111" id="Ref_111" href="#Foot_111">[111]</a></span>
It
must be no small matter that must satisfy a serious
christian to cast his soul upon any hurtful or dangerous
disadvantage. Though Daniel and his companions
may live well on pulse, yea, and Ezekiel
upon bread baked with dung, when God will have it
so, yet no wise man will choose such a diet: especially
if his diseases require the exactest diet, or
his weakness the most restorative, and all too little;
which, alas, is the common case. Yet this caution
you must here take with you, 1. That you pretend
not your own benefit, to the common loss or hurt of
others. 2. And that you consider as well where you
may do most good, as where you may get most; for
the way of greatest service, is the way of greatest gain.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Understand what sort and measure of
belief it is that you owe to your teachers, that so
your incredulity hinder not your faith in Christ, nor
your over-much credulity betray you to heresy, nor
make you the servants of men, contrary to Matt.
xxiii. 8-10; Eph. iv. 13; 2&nbsp;Cor. i. 24; Acts xx.
30. We see on one side how many poor souls are
cheated into schism and dangerous errors, by forsaking
their teachers and refusing their necessary
help, and all upon this pretence, that they must not
make men the lords of their faith, nor pin their faith
on the minister's sleeve, nor take their religion
upon trust. And on the other side we see among
the papists, and in every sect, what lamentable work
is made by an over-much credulity and implicit belief
of ambitious, worldly, factious, proud, and erroneous
guides. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The order and credit of
ministerial teaching the doctrine of salvation.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>That you may escape both these extremes,
you must observe the truth of these conclusions following, which show
you what it is that your teachers have to reveal unto you, and in what
order, and how far the several particulars are, or are not to be taken
upon their words.</p>

<p>And first, as a preparative, it is presupposed,
(1.) That you find yourself ignorant, and one that
needeth a teacher; for if you think you know all
that you need to know already, you are like a full
bottle that will hold no more. (2.) It is presupposed
that you take the man that you learn of to be
wiser than yourself, and fit to teach you; either because
fame or other men's reports have told you so,
(as the woman, John iv. drew the Samaritans to
Christ,) or because his own profession of skill doth
make you think so (as you will hearken to him that
professeth to be able to teach you any art or
science); or else because your present hearing his
discourse doth convince you of his wisdom; by one
of these means you are brought to think that he is
one that you may learn of, and is fit for you to hear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">{586}</a></span>
(so that here is no need that first you take him to be
infallible, or that you know which is the true church,
as the papists say). These are supposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know yourself.</div>

<p>The doctrines which he is to teach
you are these, and in this method
to be taught. 1. He will teach you the natural
knowledge of yourself; that being a man, you are
a rational, free agent, made by another for his will
and use, and by him to be ruled in order to your ultimate
end, being wholly his, and at his disposal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know God and holiness.</div>

<p>2. He will next teach you that
there is a God that made you, and
what he is, and what relation he
standeth in to you, and you to him, as your Creator,
your Owner, your Ruler, and your Benefactor, and
your End: and what duty you owe him in these relations,
to submit to him, and resign yourselves to
him as his own, to be obedient to all his laws, and
to love him and delight in him; and this with all
your heart, and soul, and might; even to serve him
with all the powers of your soul and body, and with
your estates and all his blessings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know the life to come.</div>

<p>3. He will next teach you that
this God hath made your souls immortal,
and that there is a life after
this where everlasting happiness or misery will be
your part, and where the great rewards and punishments
are executed by the Judge of all the world as
men have behaved themselves in this present life.
That your end and happiness is not here, but in the
life to come, and that this life is the way and time
of preparation, in which everlasting happiness is
won or lost.</p>

<p>Thus far he needeth no supernatural proof of what
he saith; but can prove it all to you from the light
of nature: and these things you are not primarily to
receive of him as a testifier by mere believing him;
but as a teacher, by learning of him the evidences by
which you may by degrees come to know these
things yourselves.</p>

<p>Yet it is supposed that all along you give him so
much credit as the difference between his knowledge
and yours doth require, so far as it appeareth
to you; as you will hear a physician, a lawyer, a
philosopher, or any man, with reverence, while he
discourseth of the matters of his own profession; as
confessing his judgment to be better than yours, and
therefore more suspecting your own apprehensions
than his. Not but that the truth may compel you
to discern it, though you should come with no such
reverence or respect to him; but then you cast
yourself upon much disadvantage irrationally; and
this human belief of him is but a medium to your
learning, and so to the knowledge of the matter; so
that you do not stop and rest in his authority or
credibility, but only use it in order to your discovery
of that evidence which you rest in, which as a teacher
he acquaints you with.</p>

<p>These things being thus far revealed by natural
light, are (usually) at first apprehended by natural
reason, not so as presently to put or prove the soul
in a state of saving grace; but so as to awaken it to
make further inquiry; and so when the soul is come
so far as to see the same truths by supernatural
grace in the supernatural revelation of the holy
Scriptures, then they become more effectual and
saving, which before were known preparatorily;
and so the same truths are then both the objects of
knowledge and of faith.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know that Christ, faith, repentance,
and obedience, is the way to it.</div>

<p>4. Having acquainted you with
man's ultimate end and happiness in
the life to come, the next thing to be
taught you by the ministers of Christ,
is, that Christ as our Saviour, and faith, and repentance,
and sincere obedience to be performed by us
through his grace, is the way to heaven, or the
means by which we must attain this end. Though
the knowledge of the preacher's wisdom, piety, and
credibility remove some impediments which would
make the receiving of this the more difficult to you,
yet you are not to take it barely on his word, as a
point of human faith; but you are to call for his
proof of it, that you may see better reasons than his
affirmations for the entertainment of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know that this is true because God hath
revealed it; or it is his word.</div>

<p>5. The proof that he will give
you is in these two propositions:
1. God's revelations are all true. 2.
This is one of God's revelations:
this is an argument, Whatsoever God saith is true:
but this God saith, therefore this is true. The first
proposition you are not to take upon the trust of his
word, but to learn of him as a teacher to know it in
its proper evidence; for it is the formal object of
your faith: the veracity of God is first known to
you, by the same evidence and means as you know
that there is a God; and then it is by the force of
this that you believe the particular truths which are
the material object of faith. And the second proposition,
that God hath revealed this, is orderly to
be first proved, and so received upon its proper evidence;
and not taken merely upon your teacher's
word: yet if you do believe him by a human faith
as a man that is likely to know what he saith, and
this in order to a divine faith, it will not hinder, but
help your divine faith and salvation; and is indeed
no more than is your duty.</p>

<p>Here note, 1. That primarily these two great
principles of faith, God is true, and this is God's
revelation, are not themselves <i>credenda</i>, the material
objects of divine faith, but of knowledge. 2. That
yet the result of both is <i>de fide</i>, matter of faith.
3. And the same principles are secondarily <i>de fide</i>,
as it is that there is a God. For though they are
first to be known by natural evidence, yet when the
Scripture is opened to us, we shall find them there
revealed; and so the same thing may be the object
both of knowledge and of faith. 4. And faith itself
is a sort of knowledge; for though human faith
have that uncertainty in its premises, (for the most
part,) as forbiddeth us to say, (properly,) I know this
to be true, because such a man said it; yet divine
faith hath that certainty which may make it an excellent
sort of knowledge; as I have proved copiously
elsewhere. In believing man we argue thus,
Whatsoever so wise and honest a man saith, is credible,
that is, most likely to be true: but this he saith;
therefore, &amp;c. But in believing God we argue thus,
Whatever God saith is credible, that is, as infallible
truth: but this God saith; therefore, &amp;c. So that
the word credible, signifieth not the same thing in
the two arguments; nor are divine faith and human
faith the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know that the gospel is his word.</div>

<p>6. The next thing that the preacher
hath to teach you, is the proof of
the aforesaid minor proposition (for
the major was proved in the proof of a Deity); and
that is thus: The gospel which Christ and his
apostles first preached, and is now delivered in the
sacred Scriptures, is the word, or infallible revelation,
of God: but this doctrine, that Christ, with faith,
and repentance, and obedience on our parts, are the
way to life eternal, is the gospel which Christ and
his apostles first preached, &amp;c.; therefore it is the
word of God. For the minor you need not take
your teacher's word, if you can read; for you may
see it in the Bible (of which more anon): but the
major is that which all men desire to be assured
of, That the gospel is God's word. And for that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">{587}</a></span>
though a belief of your teacher is a help and good
preparatory, yet you are not there to stop, but to
use him as a teacher to show you the truth of it in
the proofs: or else you must take any thing for God's
word, which your teacher affirmeth to be such. And
the proof which he will give you, must be some
divine attestation which may be showed to those
whom we would convince.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Divine attestation of the gospel.</div>

<p>7. The divine attestation, which
he is next to show you, hath many
parts, that it may be complete and
satisfactory. 1. God's antecedent testimony. 2. His
inherent or impressed testimony. 3. His adherent,
concomitant testimony. 4. His subsequent testimony.
1. God's antecedent testimony by which he
attested the gospel, is the train of promises, prophecies,
types, and the preparing ministry of John,
which all foretold Christ, and were fulfilled in him.
2. God's impressed testimony is that image and
superscription of God, (in his governing wisdom,
holiness, and love,) which is inimitably engraven on
the gospel; as an image upon a seal, which is
thereby made the instrument to imprint the same
on other things. Thus as the sun, the gospel shineth,
and proveth itself by its proper light. 3. The
concomitant attestation of God, is that of multitudes
of certain, uncontrolled miracles, done by Christ
and his apostles, which proved the approving hand
of God, and oblige all rational creatures to believe a
testimony so confirmed to them. Among these,
Christ's own resurrection and ascension, and the
gifts of his apostles, are the chief. 4. The subsequent
attestation of God is, the power and efficacy
of the gospel, in calling and sanctifying unto Christ
a peculiar people, zealous of good works, and directing
and confirming them against all temptations
and torments to the end; producing that same image
of God on the souls of his elect, which is (more
perfectly) engraven on the world itself; making
such changes, and gathering such a people unto God,
as no other doctrine ever did. And all these four
attestations are but one, even the Holy Spirit, who
is become the great witness of Christ and his gospel
in the world: viz. 1. The Spirit of prophecy is the
antecedent attestation. 2. The holy image which
the Spirit hath printed on the gospel itself, is the
inherent evidence. 3. The miracles of the Spirit,
is the concomitant attestation or evidence. 4. And
the sanctifying work of the Spirit is the subsequent
attestation, renewed and accompanying it to the end
of the world. So that the argument runs thus, That
doctrine which hath this witness of the Holy Ghost,
antecedently in such prophecies, inherently bearing
his image so inimitably, accompanied by so many
certain, uncontrolled miracles, and followed and attended
with such matchless success in the sanctification
of the body of Christ, is fully attested by
God to be his own: but such is the doctrine of the
gospel; therefore, &amp;c. The major you are not to
take upon trust from your teachers, though your
esteem of their judgment may the better dispose you
to learn; but you are to discern the evidences of
truth which is apparent in it. For he that denieth
this, must by force of argument be driven to deny,
1. Either that God is the Governor of the world; or
that he is the supreme, but say he is controlled by
another. 2. Or that he is good and true; and must
affirm that he either governeth the world by mere
deceits, and undiscernible lies, or that he hath given
up the power to some one that so governeth it: all
which is but to affirm that there is no God (which
is supposed to be proved before).</p>

<div class="sidenote">To know the matters of fact subservient to our faith.</div>

<p>8. There now remaineth nothing
to be taught you, as to prove the
truth of the gospel, but only those
matters of fact which are contained
and supposed in the minor of the two last arguments:
and they are these particulars. 1. That there were
such persons as Christ and his apostles, and such a
gospel preached by them. 2. That such miracles
were done by them, as are supposed. 3. That both
doctrine and miracles were committed to writing
by them, in the Scriptures, for the certainer preserving
them to the church's use.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_112" id="Ref_112" href="#Foot_112">[112]</a></span>
4. That churches
were planted, and souls converted and confirmed by
them in the first ages, many of whom did seal them
with their blood. 5. That there have been a succession
of such churches as have adhered to this
Christ and gospel. 6. That this which we call the
Bible is that very book containing those sacred
writings afore-mentioned. 7. That it hath been still
copied out and preserved without any such depravation
or corruption as might frustrate its ends. 8.
That the copies are such out of which we have
them translated, and which we show. 9. That they
are so truly translated as to have no such corruptions
or mistakes, as to frustrate their ends, or make them
unapt for the work they were appointed to. 10. That
these particular words are indeed here written which
we read; and these particular doctrines containing
the essentials of christianity, together with the rest
of the material objects of faith.</p>

<p>All these ten particulars are matters of fact that
are merely subservient to the constituting principles
of our faith, but yet very needful to be known. Now
the question is, How these must be known and received
by us so as not to invalidate our faith? and
how far our teachers must be here believed? And
first it is very useful to us to inquire, How so many
of these matters of fact as were then existent were
known to the first christians? As how knew they in
those days that there were such persons as Christ
and his apostles? that they preached such doctrines,
and spake such languages, and did such works,
and that they wrote such books, and sent such epistles
to the churches, and that churches were hereby
converted and confirmed, and martyrs sealed this
with their blood, &amp;c.? It is easy to tell how they
were certain of all these; even by their own eyes,
and ears, and sensible observation, as we know that
there are Englishmen live in England; and those
that were remoter from some of the matters of fact,
knew them by such report of those that did see
them, as those among us that never saw the king,
or court, or his restoration, do know that such a
thing there was, and such a person there is. Thus
they knew it then.</p>

<p>From whence I note, 1. That in those days it was
not necessary to the being of true faith, that any
supernatural testimony of the Spirit, or any other
sort of proof, than their very senses and reason,
should acquaint them with those matters of fact
which they were eye-witnesses of. 2. That credible
report or history was then the means for any one
that saw not a matter of fact, to know as much as
they that saw it. 3. That therefore this is now the
way also of producing faith. Some things we have
yet sight and sense for; as that such Bibles and
such churches are existent; that such holy effects
this doctrine hath upon the soul (which we see in
others by the fruits, and after feel in ourselves): the
rest we must know by history, tradition, or report.</p>

<p>And in the reception of these historical passages
note further, 1. That human belief is here a naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">{588}</a></span>
necessary means to acquaint us with the
matter of our divine belief. 2. That there are
various degrees of this belief, and some need more
of it by far than others, according to the various
degrees of their ignorance:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_113" id="Ref_113" href="#Foot_113">[113]</a></span>
as he that cannot read
himself, must know by human belief (in great part)
that the preacher readeth truly, or that such words
indeed are in the gospel as he saith are there; but a
literate person may know this by his eye-sight, and
not take it upon trust. So he that understandeth not
Hebrew and Greek, must take it upon trust that the
Scripture is truly translated; but another that understandeth
those tongues, may see it with his eyes.
3. History being the proper means to know matters of
fact that are done in times past, and out of our sight,
the same industry that is necessary to a thorough acquaintance
with other history, is necessary to the
same acquaintance with this. 4. That the common
beginning of receiving all such historical truths is
first by believing our teachers so far as becometh
learners, and in the mean time going on to learn till
we come to know as much as they, and upon the
same historical evidence as they. 5. That if any
man be here necessitated to take more than others
upon the trust or belief of their teachers, it is long
of their ignorance: and therefore if such cry out
against their taking things on trust, it is like a mad-man's
raving against them that would order him; or
as if one should reproach a nurse for feeding infants,
and not letting them feed themselves. <i>Oportet discentem
credere.</i> He that will not believe his teacher
will never learn. If a child will not believe his
master that tells him which are the letters, the
vowels, and consonants, and what is their power, and
what they spell, and what every word signifieth in
the language which he is teaching him, will he be
ever the better for his teaching? 6. That he that
knoweth these historical matters no otherwise than
by the belief of his particular teacher, may nevertheless
have a divine and saving faith; for though
he believe by a human faith that these things were
done, that this is the same book, &amp;c., yet he believeth
the gospel itself (thus brought to his knowledge)
because God is true that hath attested it.
Even as it was a saving faith in Mary and Martha, that
knew by their eyes and ears, and not only by belief,
that Lazarus was raised, and that Christ preached
thus and thus to them; but believed his doctrine to
be true, because of God's veracity who attested it.
7. That it is the great wisdom and mercy of God to
his weak and ignorant people, to provide them
teachers to acquaint them with these things, and to
vouchsafe them such a help to their salvation, as to
make it a standing office in his church to the end of
the world, that the infants and ignorant might not be
cast off, but have fathers, and nurses, and teachers
to take care of them. 8. But especially mark, that
yet these infants have much disadvantage in comparison
of others, that know all these matters of
fact by the same convincing evidence as their teachers;
and that he that followeth on to learn it as he
ought, may come to prove these subservient matters
of fact, by such a concurrence of evidences, as
amounteth to an infallibility or moral certainty, beyond
mere human faith as such: as e.&nbsp;g. an illiterate
person that hath it but from others, may be certain
that it is indeed a Bible which is ordinarily read and
preached to him; and that it is so truly translated
as to be a sufficient rule of faith and life, having no
mistake which must hazard a man's salvation; because
the Bible in the original tongues is so commonly
to be had, and so many among us understand
it, and there is among them so great a contrariety of
judgments and interests, that it is not possible but
many would detect such a public lie, if any should
deal falsely in so weighty and evident a case. There
is a moral certainty (equal to a natural) that some
actions will not be done by whole countries, which
every individual person hath power and natural
liberty to do: as e.&nbsp;g. there is no man in the kingdom
but may possibly kill himself, or may fast to-morrow,
or may lie in bed many days together;
and yet it is certain, that all the people in England
will do none of these: so it is possible that any
single person may lie even in a palpable public case,
as to pretend that this is a Bible when it is some
other book, or that this is the same book that was
received from the apostles by the churches of that
age, when it is not it, &amp;c.; but for all the country,
and all the world that are competent witnesses, to
agree to do this, is a mere impossibility, I mean such
a thing as cannot be done without a miracle, yea,
a universal miracle. And more than so, it is impossible
that God should do a miracle to accomplish
such a universal wickedness and deceit; whereas it
is possible that natural causes by a miracle may be
turned out of course, where there is nothing in the
nature of God against it (as that the sun should
stand still, &amp;c.). We have a certainty that there was
a Julius Cæsar, a William the Conqueror, an Aristotle,
a Cicero, an Augustine, a Chrysostom, and that
the laws and statutes of the land were really enacted
by the kings and parliaments whose names they
bear; because the natural and civil interests of so
many thousands that are able to detect it, could
never be reconciled here to a deceit. When judges
and counsellors, kings and nobles, and plaintiffs and
defendants, utter enemies, are all agreed in it, it is
more certain to a single person than if he had seen
the passing of them with his eyes. So in our case,
when an office was established in the church, to
read and preach this gospel in the assemblies; and
when all the congregations took it as the charter of
their salvation, and the rule of their faith and life;
and when these pastors and churches were dispersed
over all the christian world, who thus worshipped
God from day to day; and all sects and enemies
were ready to have detected a falsification or deceit;
it is here as impossible for such a kind of history, or
tradition, or testimony to be false, in such material
points of fact, as for one man's senses to deceive
him, and much more.</p>

<p>Thus I have at once showed you the true order of
the preaching, and proofs, and receiving of the several
matters of religion, and how and into what our
faith must be resolved; and how far your teachers
are to be believed. And here you must especially
observe two things: 1. That there can be no danger
in this resolution of faith, of derogating either from
the work of the Holy Ghost, or the Scriptures' self-evidence,
or any other cause whatever; because we
ascribe nothing to history or tradition which was
ascribed to any of these causes by the first christians;
but only put our reception by tradition, instead
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">{589}</a></span>
of their reception immediately by sense: our
receiving by infallible history, is but in the place of
their receiving by sight; and not in the place of self-evidence
of Scripture, or any testimony or teaching
of the Spirit. The method is exactly laid down,
Heb. ii. 3, 4, "How shall we escape if we neglect so
great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken
by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them
that heard him; God also bearing them witness,
both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles,
and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own
will?" Here is the sum of what I have been saying.</p>

<p>2. Observe also the great difference between us
and the papists in this controversy of using tradition
in the resolution of our faith. 1. They decide the main
question in gross by tradition, viz. Whether the
Scripture be the word of God? But we only decide
the questions about history or matters of fact by it,
which are subservient to the other. 2. The tradition
which most of them plead, is nothing but the authoritative
judgment of the successive pastors of the
church in a general council confirmed by the pope;
and as another faction among them saith, The reception
of the whole church, both laity and clergy;
and this church must be only the Roman faction.
But the tradition which we plead is the concurrent
testimony of friends and foes, orthodox and heretics;
and of all the churches throughout the world, both
Greek and Latin, Ethiopian, Armenian, protestants,
&amp;c. And this testimony we plead, not merely as a
human testimony, much less as such as is credible
chiefly for the mere power (real or pretended) of the
testifiers; but as such as by a concurrence of testimonies
and circumstances hath (besides the teachers'
authority) the evidences of infallible moral certainty,
in the very history; as we have of the statutes of
the realm.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Understand what kind and measure
of obedience it is that you owe your lawful pastors,
that you neither prove schismatical and unruly, nor
yet have a hand in setting up idols and usurpations
in the church. This you may learn from the foregoing
description of the pastor's work. The kind
of your obedience is commensurate to the kind of
his office and work. You are not to obey your pastors,
as civil magistrates that bear the sword; nor as
physicians, to tell you what you must do for your
health; nor as artificers, to command you how to
plough, and sow, and trade, &amp;c. (except in the morality
of these); but it is as your teachers and guides
in matters of salvation that you must obey them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_114" id="Ref_114" href="#Foot_114">[114]</a></span>
And that not as prophets or lawgivers to the church;
but as the stated officers of Christ, to open and apply
the laws that he hath given, and determine of such
circumstances as are subservient thereunto. Not as
those that have dominion of your faith, or may preach
another gospel, or contradict any truth of God, which
by Scripture or nature he hath revealed, or can dispense
with any duty which he hath commanded;
but as those that have all their power from God,
and for God and your salvation, and the good of
other men's souls; to edification only, and not to
destruction: particular cases I here purposely forbear.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Be sure that you look on them as the
officers of Christ in all that they do as such; and
see not only their natural, but their ecclesiastical
persons, that through them you may have to do with
God. Especially in preaching, and administering
the sacraments, and binding the impenitent, and absolving
the penitent, and comforting the sad and
humbled souls. All the holiness, and life, and power
of your spiritual converse with them consisteth in
your seeing and conversing with God in them, and
using them as his messengers or officers, that deliver
his message and do his work, and not their own. If
you disobey them in his work, it is God that you disobey;
and if they teach you his word, or deliver you
Christ and his benefits in the sacraments, it is Christ
himself that doth it by them as his instruments, so
far as they do it according to his commission and his
will. This observing Christ in their teaching will
possess you with due reverence and care, and cause
you to do it as a holy work; and to see Christ in
them, delivering and sealing his covenant to you,
will very much increase your joy; when man as man
is but a shadow.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. Make use of their help in private,
and not in public only: as the use of a physician is
not only to read a lecture of physic to his patients,
but to be ready to direct every person according to
their particular case (there being such variety of
temperatures, diseases, and accidents, that in dangerous
cases the direction of the judicious is needful
in the application); so here, it is not the least of
the pastoral work, to oversee the individuals, and to
give them personally such particular advice as their
case requireth. Never expect that all thy books, or
sermons, or prayers, or meditations should serve thy
turn without the counsel of thy pastors, in greater
cases; for that were but to devise how to prove
God's officers needless to his church. If thou be an
ignorant or unconverted sinner, go to the minister,
and ask him, what thou must do to be saved? and
resolve to follow his sound advice. If thou be in
doubt of any weighty point of faith or godliness, or
assaulted perilously by any adversary, or need his
advice for thy settled peace, thy assurance of pardon
and salvation, and thy preparation for death; go ask
counsel of thy pastors, and receive their help with
readiness and thankfulness: or if thou live where
there is none that is able and willing thus to help
thee, remove to them that are such, if lawfully thou
canst.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Assist you pastors in the work of God,
by the duties of your places which tend thereto: labour
by your holy, serious conference, to instruct
the ignorant, and convince the unbelieving, and convert
the ungodly, and strengthen the weak, with
whom you have fit opportunity for such work. Labour
by your holy examples, by love, and concord,
and meekness, and sobriety, and contempt of the
world, and a heavenly life, to "shine as lights in the
midst of a dark and crooked generation." Preach all
of you, by the examples of your blameless, humble, holy
lives. Oh how abundantly would this course promote
the success of the public preaching of the gospel!
If you would cause those men to see the glory and
power of the gospel in your holy and heavenly lives,
who cannot see it in itself: then many that would
not be won by the word, might be won without it
(to seek after it at least) by your conversations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_115" id="Ref_115" href="#Foot_115">[115]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">{590}</a></span>
Thus all must preach and be helpers of the ministers
of Christ.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Forsake not your faithful pastors to
follow deceivers; but adhere to them who spend and
are spent for you; defend their innocency against
false accusers; and refuse them not such maintenance
as is needful to their entire giving up themselves
to that holy work to which they are devoted.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_116" id="Ref_116" href="#Foot_116">[116]</a></span>
Read and study well Eph. iv. 13-15; Acts xx. 30.
It is for your sakes that your faithful pastors are
singled out in the world to bear the slanders and
contradictions of the wicked; and to lead the way in
the fiery trial. If they would forsake you, and that
sacred truth and duty that is needful to your salvation,
and sell you up into the hands of cruel and deceitful
men, it were as easy for them to have the applause
of men, and the prosperity of the world, as
others: it is perfidious ingratitude to forsake them
in trial, that must lose their lives and all the world,
rather than forsake you or betray your souls; or to
grudge them food and raiment that lay by the gainful
employments of the world, that they may attend
continually on the service of your souls.</p>

Satan or their own worldly advantages, saith Dr. Hammond.
Dan. i. 12, 13; Ezek. iv. 12, 15. Read c. iii. Acosta
excellently rebuking the negligence of their priests that
taught the Indians the catechism idly, and without explication,
or calling them to account about the sense, and then laid
all the fault on the blockishness of the people, when Tota
catechizendi ratio erat umbratilis, et ludicræ similis: ego
vero (inquit) si homines ingenio acerrimo, et discendi percupidi
tales præceptores nacti essent, nihil aliud quam ut
duplo ignoratiores evaderent, doceri isto modo arbitrarer.
Olim in symbolo addiscendo et intelligendo, mysteriisque
fidei agnoscendis viri ingenio præstantes et literatura celebres,
diu in catechumenorum ordine tenebantur, cum ecclesiastica
disciplina vigeret; neque ante ad fidei sacramentum
admittebantur, quam multas ab episcopo de symbolo conciones
audissent, diu et multum cum catechista contulissent;
post quas omnes curas et meditationes, magnum erat si recta
sentirent, consentanea responderent, &amp;c. And he addeth,
p. 360, Equidem sic opinor, neque ab ea opinione avelli
unquam potero, quin pessimo præceptori omnes esse auditores
hebetes credam. A bad teacher hath always bad scholars.
Even in the Roman church how little their authority can do
against profaneness and negligence, the same Acosta showeth,
l. 6. c. 2. p. 519. Cum in provinciali concilio Limensi
ab omnibus Peruensibus episcopis cæterisque gravibus viris
ad ea vitia emendenda multum operæ et studii collatum sit,
atque edita extent egregia decreta de reformatione permulta,
nihil tamen amplius perfectum est, quam si ab otiosis nautis
de republica moderanda consultatum esset. Bonific. Mogunt.
Ep. iii. mentioneth it as the error of a new-sprung sect, that
heinous sinners even so continuing may be priests. And
Ep. lxxiii. it is said, No man may be made a priest, that hath
sinned mortally after baptism, and, Si iis qui tam in episcopatu
vel presbyterio positus mortale peccatum aliquod admiserit,
non debet offerre panes Domino, quanto magis patienter
retrahat se ab hoc non tam honore quam onere, et aliorum
locum qui digni sunt non ambiat occupare. Qui enim in
erudiendis et instituendis ad virtutem populis præest, necesse
est, ut in omnibus sanctus sit, et in nullo reprehensibilis habeatur.
Qui enim aliquem de peccato arguit, ipse a peccato
debet esse immunis. Auct. Bib. Pat. Tom. ii. p. 81. If there
were somewhat too much strictness in the ancient exclusion
of them that heinously sinned after baptism from the priesthood,
let us not be as much too loose.</p>

By all this it is easy to gather whether a pastor may do
his work <i>per alium</i>. Saith Grotius de Imp. p. 290, 291,

eas duntaxat pertinet actiones quarum causa efficiens proxima
a jure indefinita est. Yet people should labour after
such maturity and stedfastness, that they might be able to
stand if their pastors be dead or taken from them by persecution,
yea, or forsake the truth themselves. Victor. Utic.
saith of the people in Africa when their pastors were banished,
and others might not be ordained in their steads: Inter
hæc tamen Dei populus in fide consistens, ut examina apum

We may not offer any violence, but only persuade: we
have not so great authority given us by the laws, as to repress
offenders; and if it were lawful for us so to do, we have no
use of any such violent power: for that Christ crowneth them
which abstain from sin, not of a forced, but of a willing mind
and purpose. Chrys. citante Bilson of Subjection, p. 526.
Et ibid. ex Hilar. If this violence were used for the true
faith, the doctrine of bishops would be against it: God needeth
no forced service. He requireth no constrained confession.
I cannot receive any man but him that is willing: I
cannot give ear, but to him that entreateth, &amp;c. Ita et Origen.

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE TRUTH AMONG CONTENDERS, AND THE
ESCAPE OF HERESY AND DECEIT.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">Though</span>
truth be naturally the object of man's understanding,
to which it hath a certain inclination,
and though it be a delightful thing to know the
truth;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_117" id="Ref_117" href="#Foot_117">[117]</a></span>
yet that which is saving meeteth with so
much opposition in the flesh, and in the world, that
while it is applauded in the general, it is resisted
and rejected in particulars; and yet while the use of
holy truth is hated and obstinately cast away, the
name and the barren profession of it is made the
matter of the glorying of hypocrites, and the occasion
of reproaching dissenters as heretics, and the
world is filled with bloody persecutions, and inhuman,
implacable enmities and divisions, by a wonderful
zeal for the name of truth, even by those men that
will rather venture on damnation, than they will
obey the truth which they so contend for. Multitudes
of men have tormented or murdered others as
heretics, who themselves must be tormented in hell
for not being christians. It concerneth us therefore
to deal very wisely and cautelously in this business.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Take heed lest there be any carnal interest
or lust which maketh you unwilling to receive
the truth, or inclineth you to error, that it may serve
that interest or lust. It is no small number of men
that are strangers or enemies to the truth, not because
they cannot attain the knowledge of it, but because
they would not have it to be truth. And
men of great learning and natural parts are frequently
thus deceived and led into error by a naughty, carnal,
biassed heart; either because that error is the vulgar
opinion, and necessary to maintain their popular reputation,
and avoid reproach; or because it is the
way of men in power, and necessary to their preferment
and greatness in the world; or because the
truth is contrary to their fleshly lusts and pleasures,
or contrary to their honour and worldly interest, and
would hazard their reputations or their lives. How
loth is a sensual, ungodly man to believe that "without
holiness none shall see God," and that he "that
is in Christ is a new creature, and that if any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, the same is none of his,
and that if they live after the flesh they shall die!"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_118" id="Ref_118" href="#Foot_118">[118]</a></span>
How loth is the ambitious minister to believe that
the way of Christ's service lieth not in worldly pomp,
or ease, or pleasures; but in taking up the cross and
following Christ in self-denial, and in being as the
servant of all, in the unwearied performance of careful
oversight and compassionate exhortations unto
all the flock! Let a controversy be raised about any
of these points, and the mind of lazy, ambitious men
doth presently fall in with that part which gratifieth
their fleshly lusts, and excuseth them from that toilsome
way of duty which they already hate. The
secret lusts and vices of a false, hypocritical heart,
are the commonest and the powerfulest arguments
for error; and such men are glad, that great men or
learned men will give so much ease to their consciences,
and shelter to their reputations, as to countenance,
or make a controversy at least of that which
their lusts desire to be true. Above all therefore
see that you come not to inquire after truth with an
unsanctified heart, and unmortified lusts, which are
a bias to your minds, and make you warp from the
truth which you inquire after; for if the carnal mind
neither is nor can be subject to the law of God, you
may easily perceive that it will be loth to believe it;
when in so doing they believe their own condemnation.
An honest, sanctified heart is fittest to entertain
the truth.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Seek after the truth for the love of
truth, and love it especially for its special use, as it
formeth the heart and life to the image and will of
God; and not for the fanciful delight of knowing;
much less for carnal, worldly ends.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_119" id="Ref_119" href="#Foot_119">[119]</a></span>
No means are
used at all as means, where the end is not first determined
of. And to do the same thing materially
to another end, is not indeed to do the same; for
thereby it is made another thing. Your physician
will come to you if you seek to him as a physician;
but not if you send to him to mend your shoes. So
if you seek knowledge for the true ends of knowledge,
to fill your hearts with the love of God, and
guide your lives in holiness and righteousness, God
is engaged to help you in the search. But if you
seek it only for to please your pride or fancy, no
wonder if you miss of it; and it is no great matter
whether you find it or not, for any good it is like to
do you. Every truth of God is appointed to be his
instrument, to do some holy work upon your heart:
let the love of holiness be it that maketh you
search after truth, and then you may expect that
God should be your teacher.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Seek after truth without too great or
too small regard to the judgment of others; neither
contemn them, nor be captivated to them. Use the
help of the wise; but give not up your reason absolutely
to any. Engage not yourselves in a party, so
as to espouse their errors, or implicitly to believe
whatever they say; for this breedeth in you a secret
desire to please your party, and interesteth you in
their dividing interest, and maketh you betray the
truth to be accounted orthodox by those you value.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_120" id="Ref_120" href="#Foot_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">{591}</a></span>
<i>Direct.</i> IV. Take heed of pride, which will make
you dote upon your own conceits, and cause you to
slight the weightiest reasons that are brought by
others, for your conviction. And if once you have
espoused an error, it will engage all your wit, and
zeal, and diligence to maintain it; it will make you
uncharitable and furious against all that cross you in
your way; and so make you either persecutors, (if
you stand on the higher ground,) or sect leaders, or
church dividers, and turbulent and censorious, if you
are on the lower ground. There is very great reason
in Paul's advice for the choice of a bishop, 1&nbsp;Tim.
iii. 6, "Not a novice; lest being lifted up with
pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
It is no more wonder to see a proud man erroneous,
and in the confidence of his own understanding, to
rage against all that tell him he is mistaken, than to
hear a drunken man boasting of his wit, to the increase
of his shame.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Take heed of slothfulness, and impatience
in searching after truth, and think not to find
it in difficult cases, without both hard and patient
studies, and ripeness of understanding to enable you
therein; and suspect all opinions which are the offspring
of idleness and ease, whatever divine illumination
they may pretend (except as you take them
from others upon trust (in a slothful way) who attained
them by diligent studies). For God that hath
called men to labour, doth use to give his blessing to
the laborious. And he that hath said by his Spirit,
1&nbsp;Tim. iv. 15, "Meditate upon these things; give
thyself wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear
to all," doth accordingly cause those men to
profit, who seek it in this laborious way of his appointment;
and he that hath said, "The desire of the
slothful killeth him," doth not use to bless the slothful
with his teachings. He that will say to him in
judgment, "Thou wicked and slothful servant," will
not encourage the slothfulness which he condemneth.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_121" id="Ref_121" href="#Foot_121">[121]</a></span>
"My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and
hide my commandments with thee; so that thou incline
thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart
to understanding; yea, if thou criest after knowledge,
and liftest up thy voice for understanding; if
thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as
for hid treasures; then shalt thou understand the
fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God: for
the Lord giveth wisdom," Prov. ii. 1-6. Mark here
to whom God giveth wisdom: all the godly are
taught of God; but mark here how it is that he
teacheth them. Not while they scorn at studies and
universities, and look that their knowledge should
cost them nothing, or that the Spirit should be instead
of serious studies, or that their understandings
should discern what is true or false at the first
appearance; but while they think no pains or patience
too great to learn the truth in the school of
Christ.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Keep out passion from your disputes,
and in the management of all your controversies in
religion. For though passion be useful both antecedently
to the resolution of the will, and consequently
to the effectual execution of its resolutions, yet it is
commonly a very great seducer of the understanding,
and strangely blindeth and perverteth the judgment;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_122" id="Ref_122" href="#Foot_122">[122]</a></span>
so that a passionate man is seldom so far from the
truth, as when he is most confident he is defending
it. When passion hath done boiling, and the heart
is cooled, and leaveth the judgment to do its work
without any clamour or disturbance, it is strange to
see how things will appear to you to be quite of
another tendency and reason, than in your passion
you esteemed them.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Keep up a sense of the evil and
danger of both extremes; and be not so wholly intent
upon the avoiding of one extreme, as to be fearless
of the other. The narrow minds of unexperienced
men are hardly brought to look on both sides
them, and to be duly sensible of the danger of both
extremes; but while they are taken up only with
the hating and opposing one sort of errors, they forget
those on the other side. And usually the sin or
error which we observe not, is more dangerous to us
than that which we do observe (if the wind of temptation
set that way).</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. When you detect any ancient error
or corruption, inquire into its original; and see
whether reformation consist not rather in a restitution
of the primitive state, than in an extirpation of
the whole. Even in popery itself there are many
errors and ill customs, which are but the corruption
of some weighty truth, and the degenerating of some
duty of God's appointment; and to reduce all, in
such cases, to the primitive verity, is the way of wise
and true reformation; and not to throw away that
which is God's, because it is fallen into the dirt of
human depravation. But in cases where all is bad,
there all must be rejected.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Pretend not to truth and orthodoxness
against christian love and peace; and so follow
truth, as that you lose not love and peace by it; "as
much as in you lieth, live peaceably with all men,"
Rom. xii. 18. Charity is the end of truth, 1&nbsp;Cor. xiii.
and it is a mad use of means, to use them against the
end. Make sure of the sincerity of your charity, and
hold it fast; and then no error that you hold will be
destructive to you: but if you know more than others,
and use your knowledge to the weakening of your
love, you are but (as our first parents) deceived and
destroyed by a desire of fleshly, uneffectual knowledge.
Such "knowledge puffeth up, but charity
edifieth," 1&nbsp;Cor. viii. 1. To contend for truth, to the
loss of love in yourselves, and the destruction of it
among others, is but to choke yourselves with excellent
food, and to imitate that orthodox, catholic
physician, that gloried that he killed his patients
<i>secundem artem</i>, by the most accurate method and excellent
rules of art that men could die by.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Pretend no truth against the power and
practice of godliness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_123" id="Ref_123" href="#Foot_123">[123]</a></span>
For this also is its proper
end; if it be not truth that is according to godliness,
it is no truth worthy our seeking or contending for.
And if it be contrary to godliness in itself, it is no
truth at all; therefore if it be used against godliness,
it is used contrary to the ends of truth. Those men
that suppress or hinder the means of knowledge, and
holiness, and concord, and edification, under pretence
of securing, defending, or propagating the orthodox
belief, will find one day, that God will give
them as little thanks for their blind, preposterous
zeal for truth, as a tender father would do to a physician,
that killed his children because they distasted
or spit out his medicines. It is usually a pitiful
defence of truth that is made by the enemies of
godliness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">{592}</a></span></p>

<h3><i>More near and particular Directions against Error.</i></h3>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Begin at the greatest, most evident, certain,
and necessary truths, and so proceed orderly to
the knowledge of the less, by the help of these:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_124" id="Ref_124" href="#Foot_124">[124]</a></span>
as
you climb by the body of the tree unto the branches.
If you begin at those truths, which spring out of
greater common truths, and know not the premises,
while you plead for the conclusion, you abuse your
reason, and lose the truth and your labour both: for
there is no way to the branches but by ascending
from the stock. The principles well laid, must be
your help to all your following knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. The two first things which you are to
learn are, what man is, and what God is: the nature
and relation of the two parties, is the first thing to
be known in order to the knowledge of the covenant
itself, and all following transactions between
God and man.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_125" id="Ref_125" href="#Foot_125">[125]</a></span>
One error here will introduce abundance.
A thousand other points of natural philosophy
you may safely be ignorant of; but if you know
not what man is, what reason is, what natural free-will
is, and what the inferior sensitive faculties are,
as to their uses, it will lay you open to innumerable
errors. In the nature of man, you must see the
foundation of his relations unto God: and if you
know not those great relations, the duties of which
must take up all our lives, you may easily foresee
the consequents of such ignorance or error. So if
you know not what God is, and what his relations to
us are, so far as is necessary to our living in the
duties of those relations, the consequents of your ignorance
will be sad. If learned men be but perverted
in their apprehensions of some one attribute of
God, (as those that think his goodness is nothing
but his benignity, or proneness to do good, or that
he is a necessary agent, doing good <i>ad ultimum posse</i>,
&amp;c.) what abundance of horrid and impious consequents
will follow!</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Having soundly understood both
these and other principles of religion, try all the
subsequent truths hereby, and receive nothing as
truth that is certainly inconsistent with any of these
principles.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_126" id="Ref_126" href="#Foot_126">[126]</a></span>
Even principles that are not of sense,
may be disputed till they are well received; and with
those that have not received them: but afterwards
they are not to be called in question; for then you
would never proceed nor build higher, if you will
stand questioning all your grounds. Indeed no
truth is inconsistent with any other truth: but yet
when two dark or doubtful points are compared together,
it is hard to know which of them to reject.
But here it is easy; nothing that contradicteth the
true nature of God or man, or any principle, must be
held.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Believe nothing which certainly contradicteth
the end of all religion. If it be of a natural
or necessary tendency to ungodliness, against the
love of God, or against a holy and heavenly mind
and conversation, it cannot be truth, whatever it
pretend.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Be sure to distinguish well betwixt revealed
and unrevealed things: and before you dispute
any question, search first whether the resolution
be revealed or not: and if it be not, lay it by;
and take it as part of your necessary submission,
to be ignorant of what God would have you ignorant,
as it is part of your obedience to labour to know what
God would have you know. And when some things
unrevealed are mixed in the controversy, take out those
and lay them by, before you go any further, and see
that the resolution of the rest be not laid upon them,
nor twisted with them, to entangle the whole in uncertainty
or confusion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_127" id="Ref_127" href="#Foot_127">[127]</a></span>
Thus God instructed Job, by
convincing him of his ignorance, and showing him
how many things were past his knowledge.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_128" id="Ref_128" href="#Foot_128">[128]</a></span>
Thus
Christ instructed Nicodemus about the work of regeneration,
so as to let him know that though the necessity
of it must be known, yet the manner of the Spirit's
accesses to the soul cannot be known, John iii. 7, 8.
And Paul in his discourse of election takes notice of
the unsearchable depths, and the creature's unfitness
to dispute with God, Rom. ix. When you find any disputes
about predetermination or predestination resolved
into such points as these: Whether God do by physical,
premoving influx, or by concourse, or by moral
operation <i>ut finis</i>, determine or specify moral acts of
man? Whether a positive decree <i>quoad actum</i> be
necessary to the negation of effects (as that such a
one shall not have grace given him, or be converted
or saved; that all the millions of possible persons,
names, and things shall not be future)? What understanding,
will, or power are formally in God?
How he knoweth future contingents? with a hundred
such like; then remember that you make use
of this rule, and say with Moses, Deut. xxix. 29,
"The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but
those things that are revealed unto us and to our
children for ever, that we may do all the words of
his law." There are many rare, profound discoveries
much gloried of by the masters of several sects,
of which you may know the sentence of the Holy
Ghost, by that instance, Col. ii. 18, "Let no man
beguile you of your reward, in a voluntary humility
and worshipping of angels, intruding into those
things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by
his fleshly mind." Reverently withdraw from things
that are unrevealed, and dispute them not.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Be a careful and accurate (though not
a vain) distinguisher; and suffer not ambiguity and
confusion to deceive you. Suspect every word in
your question, and anatomize it, and agree upon the
sense of all your common terms, before you dispute
with any adversary. It is not only in many words,
but in one word or syllable that so much ambiguity
and confusion may be contained, as may make a
long dispute to be but a vain and ridiculous wrangling.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_129" id="Ref_129" href="#Foot_129">[129]</a></span>
Is it not a ridiculous business to hear men
dispute many hours about the <i>cur credis</i>, and into
what faith is to be resolved; and in the end come
to understand, that by cur one of them speaks of
the <i>principium</i> or <i>causa veritatis</i>, and the other of
the <i>principium patefactionis</i>, or the <i>evidentia veritatis</i>,
or some other cause? And when one speaks of the
resolution of his faith as into the formal object, and
another into the subservient testimony or means, or
into the proofs of divine attestation, or many other
causes? Or to hear men dispute, Whether Christ
died for all; when by "for" one man meaneth "for
the benefit of all," and another means "in the place
or stead of all, or for the sins of all as the procuring
cause, &amp;c.?" Yet here is but a syllable to contain
this confusion! What a tedious thing is it to read
long disputes between many papists and protestants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">{593}</a></span>
about justification, while by justification one meaneth
one thing, and another meaneth quite another
thing! He that cannot force every word to make
a plain confession of its proper signification, that
the thing intended may be truly discerned in the
word, he will but deceive himself and others, with a
wordy, insignificant dispute.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Therefore be specially suspicious of
metaphors; as being all but ambiguities till an explication
hath fixed or determined the sense. It is
a noisome thing to hear some dispute upon an unexplained
metaphorical word, when neither of them
have enucleated the sense, and when there are proper
words enow.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. Take special notice of what kind of
beings your inquiry or disputation is, and let your
terms be adapted and interpreted according to the
kind of beings you dispute of. As if you be inquiring
into the nature of any grace, as faith, repentance,
obedience, &amp;c. remember that it is <i>in genere moris</i>,
a moral act; and therefore the terms are not to be
understood as if you disputed about mere physical
acts, which are considered but <i>in genere entis</i>. For
that object which must essentiate one moral act,
containeth many physical particles, which will make
up many physical acts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_130" id="Ref_130" href="#Foot_130">[130]</a></span>
If you take such a man for
your king, your commander, your master, your physician,
&amp;c. if you should at the bar, when you are
questioned for unfaithfulness, dispute upon the word
take, whether it be an act of the fantasy, or sense,
or intellect, or will, &amp;c. would you not be justly
laughed at? So when you ask, What act faith or
repentance is? which contain many particular physical
acts. When you dispute of divinity, policy,
law, war, &amp;c. you must not use the same terms in
the same sense, as when you dispute of physics, or
metaphysics.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Be sure in all your disputes that you
still keep distinguished before your eyes, the order
of being, and the order of knowing: that the questions
<i>de esse</i> lying undetermined in your way, do not
frustrate all your dispute about the question <i>de cognoscere</i>.
As in the question, Whether a man should
do such or such a thing, when he thinketh that it is
God's command? How far conscience must be
obeyed? It must first be determined <i>de esse</i>, whether
indeed the thing be commanded or lawful, or not?
before the case can be determined about the obligation
that followeth my apprehension. For, whatever
my conscience or opinion say of it, the thing either
is lawful or it is not: if it be lawful, or a duty, the
case is soon decided; but if it be not lawful, the
error of my conscience altereth not God's law, nor
will it make it lawful unto me. I am bound first to
know and then to do what God revealeth and commandedeth;
and this I shall be bound to, whatever I
imagine to the contrary; and to lay by the error
which is against it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Be sure when you first enter upon an
inquiry or dispute, that you well discover how much
of the controversy is verbal <i>de nomine</i>, and how much
is material <i>de re</i>;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_131" id="Ref_131" href="#Foot_131">[131]</a></span>
and that you suffer not your adversary
to go on upon a false supposition, that the
controversy is <i>de re</i>, when it is but <i>de nomine</i>. The
difference between names and things is so wide, that
you would think no reasonable man should confound
them: and yet so heedless in this point are ordinary
disputers, that it is a usual thing to make a great
deal of stir about a controversy before they discern
whether it be <i>de nomine</i> or <i>de re</i>. Many a hot and
long dispute I have heard, which was managed as
about the very heart of some material cause, (as
about man's power to do good, or about the sufficiency
of grace, or about justification, &amp;c.) when the
whole contest between the disputers was only or
principally <i>de nomine</i>, and neither of them seemed
to take notice of it. Be sure as soon as you peruse
the terms of your question, to sift this thoroughly,
and dispute verbal controversies but as verbal, and
not as real and material. We have real differences
enow: we need not make them seem more by such
a blind or heedless manner of disputing.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_132" id="Ref_132" href="#Foot_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. Suffer not a rambling mind in study,
nor a rambling talker in disputes, to interrupt your
orderly procedure, and divert you from your argument
before you bring it to the natural issue. But
deceiving sophisters, and giddy-headed praters, will
be violent to start another game, and spoil the chase
of the point before you: but hold them to it, or take
them to be unworthy to be disputed with, and let
them go (except it be where the weakness of the
auditors requireth you to follow them in their wild-goose
chace). You do but lose time in such rambling
studies or disputes.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. Be cautelous of admitting false suppositions;
or at least of admitting any inference that
dependeth upon them. In some cases a supposition
of that which is false may be made, while it no way
tends to infer the truth of it; but nothing must be
built upon that falsehood, as intimating it to be a
truth. False suppositions cunningly and secretly
worked into arguments, are very ordinary instruments
of deceit.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. Plead not uncertainties against certainties:
but make certain points the measure to try
the uncertain by. Reduce not things proved and
sure to those that are doubtful and justly controverted;
but reduce points disputable to those that are
past doubt.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Plead not the darker texts of Scripture
against those that are more plain and clear, nor
a few texts against many that are as plain; for that
which is interpreted against the most plain and frequent
expressions of the same Scripture is certainly
misinterpreted.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XV. Take not obscure prophecies for precepts.
The obscurity is enough to make you cautelous
how you venture yourself in the practice of
that which you understand not: but if there were no
obscurity, yet prophecies are no warrant to you to
fulfil them; no, though they be for the church's
good. Predictions tell you but <i>de eventu</i> what will
come to pass, but warrant not you to bring it to pass.
God's prophecies are ofttimes fulfilled by the wickedest
men and the wickedest means: as by the
Jews in killing Christ, and Pharaoh in refusing to
let Israel go, and Jehu in punishing the house of
Ahab. Yet many self-conceited persons think that
they can fetch that out of the revelations or the prophecies
of Daniel, that will justify very horrid
crimes, while they use wicked means to fulfil God's
prophecies.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVI. Be very cautelous in what cases you
take men's practice or example to be instead of precept,
in the sacred Scriptures. In one case a practice
or example is obligatory to us as a precept;
and that is, when God doth give men a commission
to establish the form or orders of his church and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">{594}</a></span>
worship, (as he did to Moses and to the apostles,)
and promiseth them his Spirit to lead them into all
truth, in the matters which he employeth them in:
here God is engaged to keep them from miscarrying;
for if they should, his work would be ill done, his
church would be ill constituted and framed, and his
servants unavoidably deceived. The apostles were
authorized to constitute church officers and orders
for continuance; and the Scripture, which is written
for a great part historically, acquaints us what they
did (as well as what they said and wrote) in the
building of the church, in obedience to their commission
(at least in declaring to the world what
Christ had first appointed). And thus if their practice
were not obligatory to us, their words also might
be avoided by the same pretences. And on this
ground (at least) the Lord's day is easily proved to
be of divine appointment and obligation. Only we
must see that we carefully distinguish between both
the words and practice of the apostles which were
upon a particular and temporary occasion (and obligation)
from those that were upon a universal or
permanent ground.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVII. Be very cautelous what conclusions
you raise from any mere works of Providence. For
the bold and blind exposition of these, hath led
abundance into most heinous sins: no providence is
instead of a law to us; but sometimes and ofttimes
Providence changeth the matter of our duty, and so
occasioneth the change of our obligations (as when
the husband dieth, the wife is disobliged, &amp;c.) But
men of worldly dispositions do so over-value worldly
things, that from them they venture to take the
measure of God's love and hatred, and of the causes
which he approveth or disapproveth in the world.
And the wisdom of God doth seem on purpose, to
cause such wonderful, unexpected mutations in the
affairs of men, as shall shame the principles or spirits
of these men, and manifest their giddiness
and mutability to their confusion. One year they
say, This is sure the cause of God, or else he would
never own it as he doth; another year they say, If
this had been God's cause he would never have so
disowned it: just as the barbarians judged of Paul
when the viper seized on his hand. And thus God
is judged by them to own or disown by his prospering
or afflicting, more than by his word.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVIII. In controversies which much depend
on the sincerity or experience of godly men,
take heed that you affect not singularity, and depart
not from the common sense of the godly. For the
workings of God's Spirit are better judged of by the
ordinary tenor of them, than by some (real or supposed)
case that is extraordinary.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIX. In controversies which most depend
on the testimony of antiquity, depart not from the
judgment of the ancients. They that stood within
view of the days of the apostles could better tell
what they did, and what a condition they left the
churches in, than we can do. To appeal to the ancients
in every cause, even in those where the later
christians do excel them, is but to be fools in reverence
of our forefathers' wisdom. But in points of
history, or any thing in which they had the advantage
of their posterity, their testimony is to be preferred.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XX. In controversies which depend on the
experience of particular christians or of the church,
regard most the judgment of the most experienced,
and prefer the judgment of the later ages of the
church before the judgment of less experienced
ages (except the apostolical age, that had the
greater help of the Spirit). An ancient, experienced
christian or divine is more to be regarded in many
points, which require experience, than many of the
younger sort, that are yet more zealous and of
quicker understanding and expression than the elder.
So those that we call the fathers or ancients were
indeed in the younger ages of the church, and
we that are fallen into the later and more experienced
age, have all the helps of the wisdom and experience
of the ages that were before us: and therefore
God will require at our hands an account of
these greater talents which we have received! As it
were unexcusable now in a physician that hath the
help of such voluminous institutions, observations,
and experiments of former ages, to know no more
than those former times that had no such helps;
so would it be as unexcusable for this present age of
the church to be no wiser than those former ages.
When Aquinas, Scotus, Ariminensis, and other schoolmen,
delivered the doctrine of christianity to the
church in a dress so far different from Ignatius,
Irenæus, Tertullian, Cyprian, or any of those former
ages, they certainly thought that they had attained
to a far greater excellency and accurateness in the
knowledge of divinity than those their ancestors had
attained: and whatever they swear in the Trent oath,
of not expounding any Scripture otherwise than the
fathers do, I doubt not but Suarez, and Vasquez, and
others of their modern schoolmen, thought so too,
and would have been loth to be accounted wise in
the measure only of those ancients.<span
class="fnanchor"><a href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span>
The later and elder ages of the church have had abundant experience,
e.&nbsp;g. of the tendency of ambition and papal
aspirings and usurpations; of the mischiefs of composing
and imposing the popish missals and numerous
ceremonies, and of their implicit faith, and their
concealment of the Scriptures from the vulgar, and
many such points; and if we are never the wiser for
all this experience, we are the more unexcusable;
and may be judged as the neglecters of our greater
helps.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXI. In controversies which depend most
upon skill in the languages, philosophy, or other
parts of common learning, prefer the judgment of a
few that are the most learned in those matters, before
the judgment of the most ancient, or the most
godly, or of the greatest numbers, even whole
churches, that are unlearned. In this case neither
numbers, nor antiquity, nor godliness will serve
turn: but as one clear eye will see further than ten
thousand that are purblind, so one Jerom or Origen
may judge better of a translation, or the grammatical
sense of a text, than a hundred of the other fathers
could. One man that understandeth a language is
fitter to judge of it, than a whole nation that understand
it not. One philosopher is fitter to judge of a
philosophical question, than a thousand illiterate
persons. Every man is most to be regarded in the
matters which he is best acquainted with.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXII. In controversies of great difficulty,
where divines themselves are disagreed, and a clear
and piercing wit is necessary, regard more the judgment
of a few acute, judicious, well-studied divines,
that are well versed in those controversies, than of a
multitude of dull and common wits that think to
carry it by the reputation of their number.<span
class="fnanchor"><a href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span>
It is too certainly attested by experience, that judicious
men are very few, and that the multitude of the injudicious
that have not wit enough to understand
them, nor humility enough to confess it, and to learn
of them, have yet pride and arrogancy enough to
contradict them, and often malice enough to vilify
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">{595}</a></span>
them. In such differences it is not only a sign of a
wise man to be content with the approbation of a
few, but also to have but few approvers (except
where the injudicious do implicitly believe those few
that are judicious). Commonly a very few that are
wiser than the multitude, are fain to stand by, and
compassionate not only the world but the church,
and see the disease, and the easy remedy, and all in
vain; while they are but neglected or despised by
the rest, that will not be made wiser by them.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXIII. In all contentions hold close to that
which all sides are agreed in; there is so much agreed
on, even between the papists and the protestants, as
would certainly save them all, if all of them did sincerely
believe, love, and practise it; for they all confess
that the whole canonical Scripture is true. Therefore
be more studious sincerely to hold and improve
those common truths which they all profess, than to
oppose the particular opinions of any, further than
that common truth requireth it. See that the articles
of the common creed which all profess, be unfeignedly
believed by you; and that the petitions in
the Lord's prayer be sincerely and earnestly put up
to God; and that the ten commandments be heartily
and entirely obeyed; and then no error or difference
will be damning to you.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXIV. Take nothing as necessary to salvation
in point of faith, nor as universally necessary
in point of practice, which the universal church in
every age since Christ did not receive. For if any
thing be necessary to salvation which the church received
not in every age, then the church itself of
that age could not be saved; and then the church
was indeed no church; for Christ is the Saviour of
his body. But certainly Christ had in every age a
church of saved ones, who openly professed all that
was of common necessity to salvation. An opinion
may be true which accuseth the generality in the
church of some error or imperfection; for it is most
certain that the church on earth is composed of none
(that have the use of reason) but erring and imperfect
members; but no opinion can be true that condemneth
all the church to hell, in any one age; for
the Head and Husband of the church must be her
Judge.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXV. Be not borne down by the censoriousness
of any, to overrun your own understanding
and the truth, and to comply with them in their
errors and extremes;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_134" id="Ref_134" href="#Foot_134">[134]</a></span>
but hold to the truth and
keep your station: Jer. xv. 19, "Let them return
unto thee, but return thou not unto them." It is
too usual for the younger and more injudicious sort
of christians to be most zealous about some little
opinions, ceremonies, and words, and to censure all
those that differ from them, with such bitter censures,
(as ungodly, false-hearted, &amp;c.) that hereupon some
of the more judicious forsake the truth and simplicity
of the gospel, to comply with these censurers
merely to escape them (or, as some say, that they
may keep an interest in them to do them good): but
such carnal compliances, though with the most zealous
men, will bring nothing home at last but repentance
and shame: truth, which is the means of the
good of souls, must not be betrayed as for the good
of souls.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXVI. Doubt not of well-proved truths,
for every difficulty that appeareth against them.
There is scarce any truth in the world so plain, but
in your own thoughts, or in the cavils of a wrangling
wit, there may such difficulties be raised as you
can hardly answer: and there is scarce any thing so
evident, that some will not dispute against. You see
that even the learnedest Jesuits, and all the clergy of
the Roman kingdom, will not stick to dispute all the
world (if they could) out of the belief of all their
senses, while they maintain that bread is not bread,
and wine is not wine. And yet, how many princes,
lords, and rulers follow them, and many millions of
the people; because they are not able to confute
them. If they had said that a man is no man, but a
worm, Psal. xxii. 6, they might in reason have
expected as much belief.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXVII. Abuse not your own knowledge
by subjecting it to your carnal interest or sensuality.
He that will sin against his conscience, and will
not obey the knowledge which he hath, doth deserve
to be given over to blindness and deceit, and
to lose even that which he hath, and to be forsaken
till he believe and defend a lie:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_135" id="Ref_135" href="#Foot_135">[135]</a></span>
"that all they
might be damned who obeyed not the truth, but had
pleasure in unrighteousness," 2&nbsp;Thess. ii. 10-12.
God will not hold him guiltless who debaseth his
sacred truth so far, as to make it stoop to his commodity
and lust; where he is a teacher he will be a
king, and sendeth his truth as the instrument of his
government, and not as a slave or pander to the flesh.
He that will "do God's will shall know it," John vii.
17; but the carnal mind that cannot be subject to
God's law, is unfit to receive it, because it is spiritually
discerned, Rom. viii. 7; 1&nbsp;Cor. ii. 14.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS FOR THE UNION AND COMMUNION OF SAINTS, AND THE AVOIDING
UNPEACEABLENESS AND SCHISM.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
peace and concord of believers is a thing that almost
all those plead for, who call themselves believers;
and yet a thing that almost all men hinder and
resist while they commend it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_136" id="Ref_136" href="#Foot_136">[136]</a></span>
The discord and divisions
of believers, are as commonly spoken against,
and by the same men, as commonly fomented. The
few that are sincere (both rulers and private men)
desire concord and hate divisions in love to holiness
which is promoted by it, and in love to the church,
and good of souls, and the honour of religion and
the glory of God; and the few of those that are experienced,
wise, judicious persons, do choose the
means that is fittest to attain these ends, and do prudently
and constantly prosecute them accordingly;
but these being in the world as a spoonful of fresh
water cast into the sea, or a spoonful of water cast
into the flames of a house on fire, no wonder if the
brinish sea be not sweetened by them, nor the consuming,
raging fire quenched by them. The other
rulers of the world and of the churches, are for concord
and against division, because this tendeth to
the quieting of the people under them, and the making
of men submissive and obedient to their wills,
and so to confirm their dignities, dominions, and interests.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_137" id="Ref_137" href="#Foot_137">[137]</a></span>
And all men that are not holy, being predominantly
selfish, they would all be themselves the
centre of that union, and bond of that concord which
they desire: and they would have it accomplished
upon such terms and by such means as are most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">{596}</a></span>
agreeable to their principles and ends; in which
there are almost as many minds as men: so that
among all the commenders of unity and concord,
there are none that take the way to attain it, but those
that would centre it all in God, and seek it upon his
terms, and in his way. The rest are all tearing
unity and peace in pieces, while they commend it,
and they fight against it while they seek it; every
man seeking it for himself, and upon his own terms,
and in his own way; which are so various and inconsistent,
that east and west may sooner meet
than they.</p>

<p>Yet must the sons of God be still the sons of
peace, and continue their prayers and endeavours for
unity, how small soever be the hopes of their success:
"If it be possible, as much as in us lieth, we
must live peaceably with all men," Rom. xii. 18.
So far must they be from being guilty of any schisms
or unlawful divisions of the church, that they must
make it a great part of their care and work to preserve
the unity and peace of christians. In this
therefore I shall next direct them.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Understand first wherein the unity of
christians and churches doth consist: or else you
will neither know how to preserve it, nor when you
violate it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_138" id="Ref_138" href="#Foot_138">[138]</a></span>
Christians are said to be united to
Christ, when they are entered into covenant with
him, and are become his disciples, his subjects, and
the members of his (political) body. They are
united to one another when they are united to Christ
their common Head, and when they have that spirit,
that faith, that love, which is communicated to every
living member of the body. This union is not the
making of many to be one christian, but of many
christians to be one church; which is considerable
either as to its internal life, or its external order and
profession. In the former respect the bonds of our
union are, 1. The heart covenant (or faith). 2. And
the Spirit: the consent of Christ and of ourselves
concurring, doth make the match or marriage between
us; and the Spirit communicated from him to
us is as the nerves or ligaments of the body, or
rather as the spirits which pass through all. The
union of the church considered visibly in its outward
policy, is either that of the whole church, or of the
particular churches within themselves, or of divers
particular churches accidentally united. 1. The union
of the whole is essential, integral, or accidental.
The essential union is that relation of a head and
members, which is between Christ and all the visible
members of his church: the foundation of it is the
mutual covenant between Christ and them, considered
on their part as made externally, whether sincerely
or not: this is usually done in baptism, and
is the chiefest act of their profession of the faith.
Thus the baptismal covenant doth constitute us
members of the visible church. The integral and
accidental union I pass by now. 2. Besides this
union of the universal church with Christ the universal
Head, there is in all particular organized
churches, a subordinate union, (1.) Between the
pastor and the flock. (2.) Between the people one
towards another;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_139" id="Ref_139" href="#Foot_139">[139]</a></span>
which consisteth in these their
special relations to each other. 3. And there is an
accidental union of many particular churches: as
when they are united under one civil government;
or consociated by their pastors in one synod or council.
These are the several sorts of church union.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Understand also wherein the communion
of christians and churches doth consist; that
you may know what it is that you must hold to. In
the universal church your internal communion with
Christ consisteth in his communication of his Spirit
and grace, his word and mercies unto you; and in
your returns of love, and thanks, and obedience unto
him; and in your seeking to him, depending on him,
and receivings from him: your internal communion
with the church or saints, consisteth in mutual love,
and other consequent affections, and in praying for
and doing good to one another as yourselves, according
to your abilities and opportunities. Your external
communion with Christ and with most of the
church in heaven and earth, is not mutually visible
and local; for it is but a small number comparatively
that we ever see; but it consisteth in Christ's visible
communication of his word, his officers, and his ordinances
and mercies unto you, and in your visible
learning and reception of them, and obedience to
him, and expressions of your love and gratitude towards
him. Your external communion with the
universal church, consisteth in the prayers of the
church for you, and your prayers for the church; in
your holding the same faith, and professing to love
and worship the same God, and Saviour, and Sanctifier,
in the same holy ordinances, in order to the
same eternal end.</p>

<p>Your external communion in the same particular
congregations, consisteth in your assembling together
to hear the preaching of God's word, and to
receive the sacrament of the body and blood of
Christ, and pray and praise God, and to help each
other in knowledge and holiness, and walk together
in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>Your communion with other neighbour churches,
lieth in praying for and counselling each other, and
keeping such correspondencies as shall be found
necessary to maintain that love, and peace, and holiness
which all are bound to seek, according to your
abilities and opportunities.</p>

<p>Note here, that communion is one thing, and subjection
is another. It is not your subjection to other
churches that is required to your communion with
them. The churches that Paul wrote to at Rome,
Corinth, Galatia, Ephesus, Philippi, &amp;c. had communion
together according to their capacities in that
distance; but they were not subject one to another,
any otherwise than as all are commanded to be subject
to each other in humility, 1&nbsp;Pet. v. 5. The church
of Rome now accuseth all the christians in the world
of separating from their communion, unless they will
take them for their rulers, and obey them as the
mistress church: but Paul speaketh not one syllable
to any of the churches of any such thing, as their
obedience to the church of Rome. To your own
pastors you owe subjection statedly as well as communion;
and to other pastors of the churches of
Christ (fixed or unfixed) you owe a temporary subjection
so far as you are called to make use of them
(as sick persons do to another physician, when the
physician of the hospital is out of the way): but one
church is not the ruler of another, or any one of all
the rest, by any appointment of the King of the
church.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. By the help of what is already said,
you are next distinctly to understand how far you
are bound to union or communion with any other
church or person, and what distance, separation, or
division is a sin, and what is not: that so you may
neither causelessly trouble yourselves with scruples,
nor trouble the church by sinful schism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What unity is among all christians.</div>

<p>I. There must be a union among
all churches and christians in these
particulars. 1. They have
all but one God. 2. And one Head and Saviour,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">{597}</a></span>
Jesus Christ. 3. And one Sanctifier, the Holy Ghost.
4. And one ultimate end and hope, even the fruition
of God in heaven. 5. And one gospel to teach them
the knowledge of Christ, and contain the promise of
their salvation. 6. And one kind of faith that is
wrought hereby. 7. And one and the same covenant
(of which baptism is the seal) in which they are engaged
to God. 8. And the same instrumental founders
of our faith, under Jesus Christ, even the prophets
and apostles. 9. And all members of the same
universal body. 10. And all have the same new nature
and holy disposition, and the same holy affections,
in loving God and holiness, and hating sin.
11. They all own, as to the essential parts, the same
law of God, as the rule of their faith and life, even
the sacred canonical Scriptures. 12. Every member
hath a love to the whole, and to each other, especially
to the more excellent and useful members;
and an inclination to holy communion with each
other. 13. They have all a propensity to the same
holy means and employment, as prayer, learning the
word of God, and doing good to others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_140" id="Ref_140" href="#Foot_140">[140]</a></span>
All these
things the true living members of the church have
in sincerity, and the rest have in profession.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What diversity will be in the church.</div>

<p>II. There will be still a diversity
among the churches and particular
christians in these following points,
without any dissolution of the fore-described unity.
1. They will not be of the same age or standing in
Christ; but some babes, some young men, and some
fathers. 2. They will not have the same degrees of
strength, of knowledge, and of holiness: some will
have need to be fed with milk, and be unskilful in
the word of righteousness. 3. They will differ in
the kind and measure of their gifts: some will excel
in one kind, and some in another, and some in none
at all. 4. They will differ in their natural temper,
which will make some to be more hot and some more
mild, some more quick and some more dull, some of
more regulated wits and some more scattered and
confused. 5. They will differ in spiritual health and
soundness: one will be more orthodox and another
more erroneous; one will have a better appetite to
the wholesome word than others that are inclining
to novelties and vain janglings; one will walk more
blamelessly than another; some are full of joy and
peace, and others full of grief and trouble. 6. They
differ much in usefulness and service to the body:
some are pillars to support the rest, and some are
burdensome and troublers of the church. 7. It is the
will of Christ that they differ in office and employment:
some being pastors and teachers to the rest.
8. There may be much difference in the manner of
their worshipping God; some observing days and
difference of meats and drinks, and forms and other
ceremonies, which others observe not: and several
churches may have several modes. 9. These differences
may possibly, by the temptation of Satan, arise
to vehement contentions; and not only to the censuring
and despising of each other, but to the rejecting
of each other from the communion of the several
churches, and forbidding one another to preach the
gospel, and the banishing or imprisoning one another,
as Constantine himself did banish Athanasius,
and as Chrysostom and many another have felt.
10. Hence it followeth that as in the visible church
some are the members of Christ, and some are indeed
the children of the devil, some shall be saved
and some be damned, even with the sorest damnation,
(the greatest difference in the world to come
being betwixt the visible members of the church,)
so among the godly and sincere themselves they are
not all alike amiable or happy, but they shall differ
in glory as they do in grace.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_141" id="Ref_141" href="#Foot_141">[141]</a></span>
All these differences
there have been, are, and will be in the church, notwithstanding
its unity in other things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Schism what, and of how many sorts.</div>

<p>III. The word schism cometh from
<span title="schizô">σχίζω</span>, <i>disseco</i>, <i>lacero</i>, and signifieth
any sinful division among christians.
Some papists (as Johnson) will have nothing called
schism, but a dividing oneself from the catholic
church: others maintain that there is nothing in
Scripture called schism, but making divisions in
particular churches.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_142" id="Ref_142" href="#Foot_142">[142]</a></span>
The truth is, (obvious in the
thing itself,) that there are several sorts of schism
or division. 1. There is a causing divisions in a
particular church, when yet no party divideth from
that church, much less from the universal. Thus
Paul blameth the divisions that were among the Corinthians,
while one said, I am of Paul, and another,
I am of Apollos, &amp;c. 1&nbsp;Cor. iii. 3. And 1&nbsp;Cor. xi.
18, "I hear that there be divisions among you:"
not that they separated from each other's communion,
but held a disorderly communion. Such divisions
he vehemently dissuadeth them from, 1&nbsp;Cor. i.
10. And thus he persuadeth the Romans, (xvi. 17,)
to "mark them which cause divisions and offences
among them, contrary to the doctrine which they
had learned, and avoid them;" which it seems therefore
were not such as had avoided the church first.
He that causeth differences of judgment and practice,
and contendings in the church, doth cause divisions,
though none separate from the church.</p>

<p>2. And if this be a fault, it must be a greater fault
to cause divisions from, as well as in, a particular
church, which a man may do that separateth not from
it himself: as if he persuade others to separate, or
if he sow those tares of error which cause it, or if
he causelessly excommunicate or cast them out.</p>

<p>3. And then it must be as great a sin to make a
causeless separation from the church that you are in
yourself, which is another sort of schism. If you
may not divide in the church, nor divide others from
the church, then you may not causelessly divide the
common from it yourselves.</p>

<p>4. And it is yet a greater schism, when you divide
not only from that one church, but from many, because
they concur in opinion with that one (which
is the common way of dividers).</p>

<p>5. And it is yet a greater schism, when whole
churches separate from each other, and renounce due
communion with each other without just cause: as
the Greeks, Latins, and protestants in their present
distance, must some of them (whoever it is) be found
guilty.</p>

<p>6. And yet it is a greater schism than this, when
churches do not only separate from each other causelessly,
but also unchurch each other, and endeavour
to cut off each other from the church universal, by
denying each other to be true churches of Christ.
It is a more grievous schism to withdraw from a
true church as no church, than as a corrupt church;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">{598}</a></span>
that is, to cut off a church from Christ, and the
church catholic, than to abstain from communion
with it as a scandalous or offending church.</p>

<p>7. It is yet, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, a higher degree of
schism to divide yourselves (a person or a church)
from the universal church without just cause, though
you separate from it but <i>secundum quid</i>, in some accidental
respect where unity is needful (for where
unity is not required, there disunion is no sin): yet
such a person that is separate but <i>secundum quid</i>,
from something accidental, or integral, but not essential
to the catholic church, is still a catholic christian,
though he sin.</p>

<p>8. But as for the highest degree of all, viz. to
separate from the universal church <i>simpliciter</i>, or in
some essential respect, this is done by nothing but
by heresy or apostasy. However the papists make
men believe that schismatics that are neither heretics
nor apostates, do separate themselves wholly or
simply from the catholic church, this is a mere figment
of their brains. For he that separateth not
from the church in any thing essential to it, doth not
truly and simply separate from the church, but <i>secundum
quid</i>, from something separable
from the church. <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>A heretic and apostate what.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>But whatever is essential to the church is
necessary to salvation; and he that separateth from
it upon the account of his denying any thing necessary
to salvation, is a heretic or apostate: that is,
if he do it, as denying some one (or more) essential
point of faith or religion, while he pretendeth to hold
all the rest, he is a heretic: if he deny the whole
christian faith, he is a flat apostate: and these are
more than to be schismatics.</p>

<p>The word heresy also is variously taken by ecclesiastic
writers. Austin will have heresy to be an
inveterate schism: Jerom maketh it to be some
perverse opinion: some call every schism which
gathereth a separated party from the rest, by the
name of heresy; some call it a heresy if there be a
perilous error though without any schism; some
call it a heresy only when schism is made, and a
party separated upon the account of some perilous
error. Some say this error must be damnable, that
is, in the essentials of religion; and some say, it is
enough if it be but dangerous. Among all these,
the commonest sense of a heretic is, one that obstinately
erreth in some essential point, and divideth
from the communion of other christians upon that
account. And so Paræus and many protestants take
heresy for the species, and schism for the genus.
All schism is not heresy; but all heresy, say they,
is schism. Remember that all this is but a controversy
<i>de nomine</i>, and therefore of small moment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Who are true schismatics.</div>

<p>By this that I have said you may
perceive who they be that are guilty
of church divisions: As, 1. The
sparks of it are kindled, when proud and self-conceited
persons are brain-sick in the fond estimation
of their own opinions, and heart-sick by a feverish
zeal for the propagating of them. Ignorant souls think
that every change of their opinions is made by such
an accession of heavenly light, that if they should
not bestir them to make all of the same mind, they
should be betrayers of the truth, and do the world
unspeakable wrong. When they measure and censure
men as they receive or reject their peculiar discoveries
or conceits, schism is in the egg.</p>

<p>2. The fire is blown up, when men are desirous to
have a party follow them and cry them up, and
thereupon are busy in persuading others to be of
their mind, and do speak "perverse things to draw
away disciples after them," Acts xx. 30; and when
they would be counted the masters of a party.</p>

<p>3. The flames break forth, when by this means
the same church, or divers churches, do fall into
several parties burning in zeal against each other,
abating charity, censuring and condemning one
another, backbiting and reviling each other, through
envy and strife;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_143" id="Ref_143" href="#Foot_143">[143]</a></span>
when they look strangely at one
another, as being on several sides, as if they were
not children of the same Father, nor members of the
same body; or as if Christ were divided, one being
of Paul, and another of Apollos, and another of
Cephas, and every one of a faction, letting out their
thoughts in jealousies and evil surmises of each
other; perverting the words and actions of each to
an ugly sense, and snatching occasions to represent
one another as fools or odious to the hearers, as if
you should plainly say, I pray you hate or despise
these people whom I hate and despise. This is the
core of the plague-sore; it is schism in the bud.</p>

<p>4. When people in the same church do gather into
private meetings, not under the guidance of their
pastors, to edify one another in holy exercises in
love and peace, but in opposition to their lawful pastors,
or to one another, to propagate their singular
opinions, and increase their parties, and speak
against those that are not on their side; schism is
then ready to bring forth and multiply, and the
swarm is ready to come forth and be gone.</p>

<p>5. When these people actually depart, and renounce
or forsake the communion of the church, and
cast off their faithful pastors, and draw into a separated
body by themselves, and choose them pastors
and call themselves a church, and all without any
just, sufficient cause: when thus churches are
gathered out of churches, before the old ones are
dissolved, or they have any warrant to depart; when
thus pastor is set up against pastor, church against
church, and altar against altar; this is schism ripe
and fruitful; the swarm is gone, and hived in
another place.</p>

<p>6. If now the neighbour churches, by their pastors
in their synods, shall in compassion seek to reclaim
these stragglers, and they justify their unjust separation,
and contemn the counsel of the churches and
ministers of Christ; this is a confirmed, obstinate
schism.</p>

<p>7. If they shall also judge that church to be no
church from which they separated, and so cut off a
part of the body of Christ by an unrighteous censure,
and condemn the innocent, and usurp authority
over their guides; this is disobedience and uncharitableness
with schism.</p>

<p>8. If they shall also condemn and unchurch all
the other churches that are not of their mind and
way, and renounce communion with them all, and
so condemn unjustly a great part of the body of
Christ on earth, this is to add fury and rebellion to
an uncharitable schism. And if to cover their sin,
they shall unjustly charge these churches which
they reject, with heresy or wickedness, they do but
multiply their crimes by such extenuations.</p>

<p>9. If the opinion that all this ado is made for, be
a damning error, against some essential point of the
true religion, then it is heresy as well as schism.</p>

<p>10. If this separation from the church be made in
defence of an ungodly life, against the discipline of
the church; if a wicked sort of men shall withdraw
from the church to avoid the disgrace of confession
or excommunication; and shall first cast off the
church, lest the church should proceed to cast out
them; and so they separate that they may have none
to govern and trouble them but themselves; this is a
profane, rebellious schism. This is the common
course of schism when it groweth towards the height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">{599}</a></span>
11. Besides all these, there is yet a more pernicious
way of schism, which the church or court of
Rome is guilty of: they make new articles of faith,
and new points of religion, and a new worship&mdash;of
God, shall I say, or of bread as if it were a god?
And all these they put into a law, and impose them
on all the other churches; yea, they put them into
an oath, and require men to swear that without any
doubting they believe them to be true: they pretend
to have authority for all this, as Rome is the mistress
of all other churches. They set up a new universal
head, as an essential part of the catholic
church, and so found or feign a new kind of catholic
church: and he that will not obey them in all this,
they renounce communion with him; and to hide this
horrid, notorious schism, they call all schismatics
that are not thus subjected to them.</p>

<p>12. And to advance their schism to the height, as
far as arrogance can aspire, they not only refuse
communion with those from whom they separate,
but condemn them as no pastors, no churches, no
christians, that are not subject to them in this their
usurpation; and they, that are but about the third
or fourth part (at most) of the christian world, do
condemn the body of Christ to hell (even all the
rest) because they are not subjects of the pope.</p>

<p>Besides all this criminal, odious schism, of imposers
or separaters, there is a degree of schism or
unjust division, which may be the infirmity of a
good and peaceable person. As if a humble, tender
christian should mistakingly think it unlawful to do
some action, that is imposed upon all that will hold
communion with that particular church (such as
Paul speaketh of Rom. xiv. if they had been imposed);
and if he, suspecting his own understanding,
do use all means to know the truth, and yet still continueth
in his mistake; if this christian do forbear
all reviling of his superiors, and censuring those
that differ from him, and drawing others to his
opinion, but yet dare not join with the church in
that which he taketh to be a sin, this is a sinful sort
of withdrawing, because it is upon mistake; but yet
it is but a pardonable infirmity, consistent with integrity
and the favour of God.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What separation is a duty.</div>

<p>IV. In these cases following separation
is our duty and not a sin.
1. The church's separation from the
unbelieving world is a necessary duty: for what is a
church, but a society dedicated or sanctified to God,
by separation from the rest of the world? 2&nbsp;Cor. vi.
17, 18, "Wherefore come out from among them, and
be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the
unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a
Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." The church
is a holy people, and therefore a separated people.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_144" id="Ref_144" href="#Foot_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>2. If a church apostatize and forsake the faith, or
if they turn notoriously heretical, denying openly
any one essential article of the faith, and this not
only by an undiscerned consequence, but directly in
express terms or sense, it is our duty to deny to hold
communion with such apostates or heretics; for it
is their separating from Christ that is the sinful
separation, and maketh it necessary to us to separate
from them. But this is no excuse to any church or
person, that shall falsely accuse any other church or
person of heresy, (because of some forced or disowned
consequences of his doctrine,) and then separate
from them when they have thus injured them
by their calumnies or censures.</p>

<p>3. We are not bound to own that as a church
which maketh not a visible profession of faith and
holiness; that is, if the pastors and a sufficient number
of the flock make not this profession. For as
the pastor and flock are the constituent parts of
the church, politically considered, so profession of
faith and holiness is the essential qualification of the
members. If either pastors or people want this profession,
it is no political church; but if the people
profess true religion, and have no pastors, it is a
community of believers, or a church unorganized,
and as such to be acknowledged.</p>

<p>4. If any shall unlawfully constitute a new political
church form, by making new constitutive officers
to be its visible head, which Christ never appointed,
we are not to hold communion with the church in
its devised form or polity; though we may hold
communion with the members of it considered as
christians and members of the universal church.
Mark well, that I do not say that every new devised
officer disobligeth us from such communion, but
such as I describe; which I shall fullier open.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether any form of church government be of
divine appointment; and whether man may appoint any other?</div>

<p><i>Quest.</i> May not men place new
officers in the church; and new
forms of government which God
never instituted? Or is there any
form and officers of divine institution?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Though I answered this before, I shall here
briefly answer it again. 1. There are some sorts of
officers that are essential to the polity, or church
form, and some that are only needful to the well-being
of it, and some that are only accidental. 2. There
is a church form of God's own institution, and there
is a superadded human polity, or form. There are
two sorts of churches, or church forms, of God's own
institution. The first is the universal church considered
politically as headed by Jesus Christ: this
is so of divine appointment, as that it is an article of
our creed. Here if any man devise and superinduce
another head of the universal church, which God
never appointed, though he pretend to hold his
sovereignty from Christ and under him, it is treason
against the sovereignty of Christ, as setting up a
universal government or sovereign in his church
without his authority and consent. Thus the pope
is the usurping head of a rebellion against Christ,
and in that sense by protestants called antichrist;
and he is guilty of the rebellion that subscribeth to
or owneth his usurpation, or sweareth to him as his
governor, though he promise to obey him but <i>in
licitis et honestis</i>; because it is not lawful or honest
to consent to a usurper's government. If a usurper
should traitorously, without the king's consent, proclaim
himself vice-king of Ireland or Scotland, and
falsely say that he hath the king's authority, when
the king disclaimeth him, he that should voluntarily
swear obedience to him in things lawful and honest,
doth voluntarily own his usurpation and treason.
And it is not the lawfulness and honesty of the matter
which will warrant us to own the usurpation of
the commander.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_145" id="Ref_145" href="#Foot_145">[145]</a></span>
And secondly, there is another
subordinate church form of Christ's institution; that
is, particular churches consisting of pastors and
people conjoined for personal communion in God's
worship. These are to the universal church, as
particular corporations are to a kingdom, even such
parts of it as have a distinct subordinate polity of
their own: it is no city or corporation, if they have
not their mayors, bailiffs, or other chief officers,
subject to the king, as governors of the people under
him: and it is no particular church, in a political
sense, but only a community, if they have not their
pastors to be under Christ, their spiritual conductors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">{600}</a></span>
in the matters of salvation; as there is no school
which is not constituted of teacher and scholars.
That particular organized political churches are of
Christ's institution, (by his Spirit in the apostles,)
is undeniable. Acts xiv. 23, "They ordained them
elders in every church." Tit. i. 5, "Ordain elders
in every city, as I commanded thee." Acts xx. 17,
"He sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the
church." Ver. 28, "Take heed to yourselves and to
all the flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made
you overseers, to feed the church of God." So
1&nbsp;Thess. v. 12, 13; Heb. xiii. 7, 17, 24, &amp;c. 1&nbsp;Cor.
vii. 23, "If the whole church be come together into
one place," &amp;c. Thus far it is no question but
church forms and government is of divine appointment;
and man can no more alter this, or set up
such other, without God's consent, than a subject
can alter or make corporations without the king's
consent. 3. But besides these two sorts of divine
institution, there are other allowable associations
which some call churches. God hath required these
particular churches to hold such communion as they
are capable of, for promoting the common ends of
christianity; and prudence is left to determine of
the times, and places, and manner of their pastors'
assemblies, councils, and correspondencies according
to God's general rules. If any will call these councils,
or the associations engaged for special correspondencies,
by the name of churches, I will not
trouble any with a strife about the name. In this
case, so far as men have power to make that association
or combination which they call a church, so
also if they make officers suited to its ends, not encroaching
upon the churches or officers of Christ's
own institution, I am none of those that will contend
against them; nor will this allow us to deny communion
with them. And in those churches which
Christ himself hath instituted, there are officers that
make but for the integrity, and not for the political
essence of the church: as deacons, and all pastors
or presbyters more than one. For it is not essential
to it to have any deacons, or many pastors. As to
this sort of officers, Christ hath appointed them, and
it is not in man's power to alter his institution, nor to
set up any such like in co-ordination with these: but
yet if they should do so, as long as the true essentials
of the church remain, I am not to deny communion
with that church, so I own not this corruption.
4. But there are also as circumstantial employments
about God's worship, so officers to do those employments,
which men may lawfully institute: as clerks,
churchwardens, door-keepers, ringers, &amp;c. It is not
the adding of these that is any sin. By this time
you may see plainly both how far churches, officers,
and church government is <i>jure divino</i>, and how far
man may or may not add or alter, and what I meant
in my proposition, viz. That if men introduce a new
universal head to the church catholic, or a new head
to particular churches, instead of that of Christ's
institution, this is, <i>in sensu politico</i>, to make new
species of churches, and destroy those that Christ
hath instituted (for the <i>pars gubernans</i> and <i>pars
gubernata</i> are the essential constituents of a church).
And with such a church, as such, in specie, I must
have no communion (which is our case with the papal
church); though with the material parts of that church,
as members of Christ, I may hold communion still.</p>

<p>5. If particular members are guilty of obstinate
impenitency in true heresy, or ungodliness, or any
scandalous crime, the church may and must remove
such from her communion; for it is the communion
of saints. And the offender is the cause of this separation.</p>

<p>6. If a whole church be guilty of some notorious,
scandalous sin, and refuse with obstinacy to repent
and reform, when admonished by neighbour churches,
or if that church do thus defend such a sin in any of
her members, so as openly to own it; other churches
may refuse communion with her, till she repent and
be reformed. Or if they see cause to hold communion
with her in other respects, yet in this they
must have none.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_146" id="Ref_146" href="#Foot_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>7. If any church will admit none to her personal
communion, but those that will take some false oath,
or subscribe any untruth, or tell a lie, though that
church do think it to be true, (as the Trent oath
which their priests all swear,) it is not lawful to do
any such unlawful thing to obtain communion with
that church: and he that refuseth in this case to
commit this sin, is no way guilty of the separation,
but is commendable for being true to God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_147" id="Ref_147" href="#Foot_147">[147]</a></span>
And
though the case may be sad to be deprived of the
liberty of public worship, and the benefits of public
communion with that church, yet sin is worse, and
obedience is better than sacrifice.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_148" id="Ref_148" href="#Foot_148">[148]</a></span>
God will not be
served with sin, nor accept the sacrifice of a disobedient
fool, Eccles. v. 1, 2. Nor must we lie to
glorify him, nor do evil that good may come by it:
just is the damnation of such servers of God, Rom.
i. 7, 8. All public worship is rather to be omitted,
than any one sin committed to enjoy it (though
neither should be done where it is possible to do
better). It is not so unwise to think to feed a man
with poisons, as to think to serve God acceptably
by sin.</p>

<p>8. If any one church would ambitiously usurp a
governing power over others, (as Rome doth over
the world,) it is no unwarrantable separation to refuse
the government of that usurping church. We
may hold communion with them as christians, and
yet refuse to be their subjects. And therefore it is
a proud and ignorant complaint of the church of
Rome, that the protestants separate from them as to
communion, because they will not take them for
their governors.</p>

<p>9. If any by violence will banish or cast out the
true bishops or pastors of the church, and set up
usurpers in their stead, (as in the Arians' persecution
it was commonly done,) it is no culpable separation,
but laudable, and a duty, for the people to own their
relation to their true pastors, and deny communion
with the usurpers: as the people of the eastern
churches did commonly refuse communion with the
intruding bishops, even to the death, telling the civil
rulers, that they had bishops of their own, to whom
they would adhere.</p>

<p>10. If a true church will obstinately deny her
members the use of any one ordinance of God, as
preaching or reading Scripture, or prayer, or praise,
or discipline, while it retaineth all the rest, though
we may not separate from this church as no church,
(which yet in the case of total rejection of prayer
or praise, is very questionable at least,) yet if we
have opportunity, we must remove our local communion
to a more edifying church, that useth all the
public ordinances of God: unless the public good
forbid, or some great impediment or contrary duty
be our excuse.</p>

<p>11. If a true church will not cast out any impenitent,
notorious, scandalous sinner, though I am not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">{601}</a></span>
to separate from the church, yet I am bound to avoid
private familiarity with such a person, that he may
be ashamed, and that I partake not of his sin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_149" id="Ref_149" href="#Foot_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>12. As the church hath diversity of members,
some more holy, and some less, and some of whose
sincerity we have small hope, some that are more
honourable, and some less, some that walk blamelessly,
and some that work iniquity; so ministers
and private members are bound to difference between
them accordingly, and to honour and love some far
above others, whom yet we may not excommunicate;
and this is no sinful separation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_150" id="Ref_150" href="#Foot_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>13. If the church that I live and communicate
with, do hold any tolerable error, I may differ therein
from the church, without a culpable separation.
Union with the church may be continued with all
the diversities before mentioned, direct. iii.</p>

<p>14. In case of persecution in one church or city,
when the servants of Christ do fly to another, (having
no special reason to forbid it,) this is no sinful separation,
Matt. x. 23.</p>

<p>15. If the public service of the church require a
minister or private christian to remove to another
church, if it be done deliberately and upon good advice,
it is no sinful separation.</p>

<p>16. If a lawful prince or magistrate command us
to remove our habitation, or command a minister
from one church to another, when it is not notoriously
to the detriment of the common interest of religion,
it is no sinful separation to obey the magistrate.</p>

<p>17. If a poor christian that hath a due and tender
care of his salvation, do find that under one minister
his soul declineth and groweth dead, and under another
that is more sound, and clear, and lively, he is much
edified to a holy and heavenly frame and life, and
if hereupon, preferring his salvation before all things,
he remove to that church and minister where he is
most edified, without unchurching the other by his
censures, this is no sinful separation, but a preferring
the one thing needful before all.</p>

<p>18. If one part of the church have leisure, opportunity,
cause, and earnest desires to meet oftener
for the edifying of their souls, and redeeming their
time, than the poorer, labouring, or careless and less
zealous part will meet, in any fit place, under the
oversight and conduct of their pastors, and not in
opposition to the more public, full assemblies, as
they did, Acts xii. 12, to pray for Peter at the house
of Mary, "where many were gathered together praying;"
and Acts x. 1, &amp;c. this is no sinful separation.</p>

<p>19. If a man's own outward affairs require him to
remove his habitation from one city or country to
another, and there be no greater matter to prohibit it,
he may lawfully remove his local communion from
the church that he before lived with, to that which
resideth in the place he goeth to. For with distant
churches and christians I can have none but mental
communion, or by distant means (as writing, messengers,
&amp;c.); it is only with present christians that
I can have local, personal communion.</p>

<p>20. It is possible in some cases that a man may
live long without local, personal communion with
any christians or church at all, and yet not be guilty
of sinful separation. As the king's ambassador or
agent in a land of infidels, or some traveller, merchants,
factors, or such as go to convert the infidels,
or those that are banished or imprisoned. In all
these twenty cases, some kind of separation may be
lawful.</p>

<p>21. One more I may add, which is, when the
temples are so small, and the congregations so great,
that there is no room to hear and join in the public
worship; or when the church is so excessively great,
as to be uncapable of the proper ends of the society;
in this case to divide or withdraw, is no sinful separation.
When one hive will not hold the bees, the
swarm must seek themselves another, without the
injury of the rest.</p>

<p>By all this you may perceive, that sinful separation
is first in a censorious, uncharitable mind, condemning
churches, ministers, and worship causelessly, as
unfit for them to have communion with. And
secondly, it is in the personal separation which is
made in pursuance of this censure: but not in any
local removal that is made on other lawful grounds.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Understand and consider well the
reasons why Christ so frequently and earnestly
presseth concord on his church, and why he so vehemently
forbiddeth divisions. Observe how much
the Scripture speaketh to this purpose, and upon
what weighty reasons. Here are four things distinctly
to be represented to your serious consideration.
1. How many, plain, and urgent are the texts
that speak for unity, and condemn division. 2. The
great benefits of concord. 3. And the mischiefs of
discord and divisions in the church. 4. And the aggravations
of the sin.</p>

<p>I. A true christian, that hateth fornication, drunkenness,
lying, perjury, because they are forbidden in
the word of God, will hate divisions also when he
well observeth how frequently and vehemently they
are forbidden, and concord highly commended and
commanded. John xvii. 21-23, "That they all
may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
thee, that they also may be one in us; that the
world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the
glory which thou gavest me I have given them;
that they may be one, even as we are one: I in
them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect
in one; and that the world may know that thou hast
sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved
me." Here you see, that the unity of the saints
must be a special means to convince the infidel
world of the truth of christianity, and to prove God's
special love to his church, and also to accomplish
their own perfection. 1&nbsp;Cor. i. 10, "Now I beseech
you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be
no divisions (or schisms) among you; but that ye
be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and
in the same judgment. For it hath been declared to
me of you, my brethren,&mdash;that there are contentions
among you." 1&nbsp;Cor. iii. 3, "For ye are yet carnal:
for whereas there is among you envying, (zeal,) and
strife, and divisions, (or parties, or factions,) are ye
not carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith,
I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye
not carnal?" Phil. ii. 1-4, "If there be any consolation
in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the
same love, of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing
be done through strife or vain-glory, but in lowliness
of mind let each esteem others better than themselves."
Rom. xvi. 17, 18, "Now I beseech you,
brethren, mark them which cause divisions (or
parties) and offences, (or scandals,) contrary to the
doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them."
Abundance more such texts may be recited.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_151" id="Ref_151" href="#Foot_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The benefits of concord.</div>

<p>II. The great benefits of the concord
of christians are these following.
1. It is necessary to the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">{602}</a></span>
life of the church and its several members, that they
be all one body. As their union with Christ the
head and principle of their life is principally necessary,
so unity among themselves is secondarily necessary,
for the conveyance and reception of that
life which floweth to all from Christ. For though
the head be the fountain of life, yet the nerves and
other parts must convey that life unto the members;
and if any member be cut off or separated from the
body, it is separated also from the head, and perisheth.
Mark well those words of the apostle, Eph.
iv. 3-16, "Endeavouring to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace. There is one body,
and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of
your calling: one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one
God and Father of all, who is above all, and through
all, and in you all. But unto every one of us is
given grace according to the measure of the gift of
Christ.&mdash;And he gave some, apostles; and some,
prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for
the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the
body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to
a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
the fulness of Christ: that&mdash;speaking the truth in
love, we may grow up into him in all things, which
is the Head, even Christ; from whom the whole
body fitly joined together, and compacted by every
joint of supply, according to the effectual working
in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
body to the edifying of itself in love." See here
how the church's unity is necessary to its life and
increase, and to the due nutrition of all the parts.</p>

<p>2. The unity of the church, and the concord of
believers, is necessary to its strength and safety; for
Christ also strengtheneth as well as quickeneth them
by suitable means. Woe to him that is alone! but
in the army of the Lord of hosts we may safely
march on, when stragglers are catched up or killed
by the weakest enemy. A threefold cord is not
easily broken. Enemies both spiritual and corporal
are deterred from assaulting the church or any of its
members, while they see us walk in our military
unity and order. In this posture every man is a
blessing and defence unto his neighbour. As every
soldier hath the benefit of all the conduct, wisdom,
and valour of the whole army, while he keepeth in
his place; so every weak christian hath the use and
benefit of all the learning, the wisdom, and gifts of
the church, while he keepeth his station, and walketh
orderly in the church. The hand, the eye, the
ear, the foot, and every member of the body, is as
ready to help or serve the whole, and every other
particular member, as itself; but if it be cut off, it is
neither helpful, nor to be helped. Oh what mercy
is it for every christian, that is unable to help himself,
to have the help of all the church of God!
their directions, their exhortations, their love, their
prayer, their liberality and compassion, according
to their several abilities and opportunities! as infants
and sick persons have the help of all the rest
of the family that are in health.</p>

<p>3. Unity and concord, as they proceed from love,
so they greatly cherish and increase love; even as
the laying of the wood or coals together is necessary
to the making of the fire, which the separating of them
will put out.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_152" id="Ref_152" href="#Foot_152">[152]</a></span>
Holy concord cherisheth holy converse
and communion; and holy communion powerfully
kindleth holy love. When the servants of
Christ do see in each other the lustre of his graces,
and hear from each other the heavenly language
which floweth from a divine and heavenly mind, this
potently kindleth their affections to each other, and
maketh them close with those as the sons of God, in
whom they find so much of God; yea, it causeth
them to love God himself in others, with a reverent,
admiring, and transcendent love, when others, at the
best, can love them but as men. Concord is the
womb and soil of love, although it be first its progeny.
In quietness and peace the voice of peace is
most regarded.</p>

<p>4. Unity and concord is the church's beauty: it
maketh us amiable even to the eye of nature, and
venerable and terrible even to the eye of malice. A
concord in sin is no more honour, than it is for conquered
men to go together in multitudes to prison
or captivity; or for beasts to go by droves unto the
slaughter. But to see the churches of Christ with
one heart and soul acknowledging their Maker and
Redeemer, and singing his praise as with one voice,
and living together in love and concord, as those
that have one principle, one rule, one nature, one
work, one interest, and hope, and end, this is the
truly beauteous symmetry, and delectable harmony.
Psal. cxxxiii. "Behold how good and how pleasant
it is for brethren to dwell together in unity! It is
like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran
down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard, that went
down to the skirts of his garment. As the dew of
Hermon, and as the dew that descendeth upon the
mountains of Zion: for there the Lord commanded
the blessing, even life for evermore." The translators
well put this as the contents of this psalm,
"The benefit of the communion of saints."</p>

<p>5. The concord of believers doth greatly conduce
to the successes of the ministry, and propagation
of the gospel, and the conviction of unbelievers,
and the conversion and salvation of ungodly souls.
When Christ prayeth for the unity of his disciples,
he redoubled this argument from the effect or end,
"that the world may believe that thou hast sent
me;" and "that the world may know that thou hast
sent me, and hast loved them," &amp;c. John xvii. 21, 23.
Would this make the world believe that Christ was
sent of God? Yes, undoubtedly if all christians
were reduced to a holy concord, it would do more to
win the heathen world, than all other means can do
without it. It is the divisions and the wickedness
of professed christians, that maketh christianity so
contemned by the Mahometans, and other infidels of
the world; and it is the holy concord of christians
that would convince and draw them home to Christ.
Love, and peace, and concord are such virtues, as
all the world is forced to applaud, notwithstanding
nature's enmity to good. When the first christian
church "were all with one accord in one place, and
continued daily with one accord in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house partook of food
with gladness and singleness of heart," and when "the
multitude of believers were of one heart and of one
soul," Acts ii. 1, 46; iv. 32, then did "God send upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">{603}</a></span>
them the Holy Ghost, and then were three thousand
converted at a sermon," Acts ii. 41; and with "great
power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection
of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them
all," Acts iv. 33.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How our concord would promote the conversion of infidels.</div>

<p>Our concord in religion hath all
these advantages for the converting
of unbelievers and ungodly men.
1. It is a sign that there is a constraining
evidence of truth in that gospel which
doth convince so many; a concurrent satisfaction and
yielding to the truth, is a powerful testimony for it.
2. They see then that religion is not a matter of
worldly policy and design, when so many men of
contrary interests do embrace it. 3. And they see
it is not the fruit of melancholy constitutions, when
so many men of various temperatures entertain it.
4. They may see that the gospel hath power to conquer
that self-love and self-interest which is the
most potent thing in vitiated nature: otherwise it
could never make so many unite in God as their
common interest and end. 5. They may see that
the gospel and Spirit of Christ are stronger than the
devil and all the allurements of the flesh and world,
when they can make so many agree in the renouncing
of all earthly vanities, for the hopes of everlasting
life. 6. They will see that the design and doctrine
of christianity are good and excellent, beseeming
God, and desirable to man; when they see that
they produce so good effects, as the love, and unity,
and concord of mankind. 7. And it is an exceeding
great and powerful help to the conversion of the
world in this respect, because it is a thing so conspicuous
in their sight, and so intelligible to them, and
so approved by them. They are little wrought on
by the doctrine of Christ alone, because it is visible
or audible but to few, and understood by fewer, and
containeth many things which nature doth distaste;
but the holy concord of believers is a thing that
they are more able to discern and judge of, and do
more generally approve. The holy concord of christians
must be the conversion of the unbelieving
world, if God have so great a mercy for the world;
which is a consideration that should not only deter
us from divisions, but make us zealously study and
labour with all our interest and might, for the healing
of the lamentable divisions among christians, if
we have the hearts of christians, and any sense of
the interest of Christ.</p>

<p>6. The concord of christians doth greatly conduce
to the ease and peace of particular believers. The
very exercise of love to one another doth sweeten
all our lives and duties; we sail towards heaven in
a pleasant calm, with wind and tide, when we live
in love and peace together. How easy doth it make
the work of godliness! How light a burden doth religion
seem, when we are all as of one heart and soul!</p>

<p>7. Lastly, consider whether this be not the likest
state to heaven, and therefore have not in it the
most of christian excellency and perfection? In
heaven there is no discord, but a perfect consort of
glorified spirits, harmoniously loving and praising
their Creator. And if heaven be desirable, holy
concord on earth is next desirable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The mischiefs of division.</div>

<p>III. On the contrary, consider
well of the mischiefs of divisions.
1. It is the killing of the church, (as
much as lieth in the dividers,) or the wounding it at
least. Christ's body is one, and it is sensible; and
therefore dividing it tendeth directly to the destroying
it, and at least will cause its smart and pain.
To reform the church by dividing it, is no wiser than
to cut out the liver, or spleen, or gall, to cleanse
them from the filth that doth obstruct them, and
hinder them in their office; you may indeed thus
cleanse them, but it will be a mortal cure. As he
that should divide the kingdom into two kingdoms
dissolveth the old kingdom, or part of it at least, to
erect two new ones; so he that would divide the
catholic church into two, must thereby destroy it, if
he could succeed; or destroy that part which divideth
itself from the rest. Can a member live that is cut
off from the body, or a branch that is separated from
the tree?</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> O but, say the Romanists, why then do
you cut off yourselves from us? the division is made
by you, and we are the church, and you are dead
till you return to us. How will you know which
part is the church, when a division is once made?
<i>Answ.</i> <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Whether papists or
protestants are schismatics.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>Are you the church? Are you the only
christians in the world? The church is, all christians united
in Christ their Head. You traitorously set up a new
usurping head; and proclaim yourselves to be the
whole church, and condemn all that are not subjects
to your new head: we keep our station, and disclaim
his usurpation, and deny subjection to you,
and tell you that as you are the subjects of the pope,
you are none of the church of Christ at all; from
this treasonable conspiracy we withdraw ourselves;
but as you are the subjects of Christ we never divided
from you, nor denied you our communion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_153" id="Ref_153" href="#Foot_153">[153]</a></span>
Let reason judge now who are the dividers. And
is it not easy to know which is the church in the
division? It is all those that are still united unto
Christ: if you or we be divided from Christ and from
christians that are his body, we are then none of the
church; but if we are not divided from Christ, we
are of the church still: if part of a tree (though the
far greater part) be cut off or separated from the
rest, it is that part (how small soever) that still
groweth with the root that is the living tree. The
Indian fig tree, and some other trees, have branches
that take root when they touch the ground: if now
you ask me whether the branches springing from
the second root, are members of the first tree, I
answer, 1. The rest that have no new root are more
undoubtedly members of it. 2. If any branches are
separated from the first tree, and grow upon the
new root alone, the case is out of doubt. 3. But if
yet they are by continuation joined to both, that
root which they receive their nutriment most from,
is it which they most belong to. Suppose a tyrant
counterfeit a commission from the king to be vice-king
in Ireland, and proclaim all them to be traitors
that receive him not; the king disclaimeth him, the
wisest subjects renounce him, and the rest obey him
but so as to profess they do it because they believe
him to be commissioned by the king. Let the question
be now, who are the dividers in Ireland? and
who are the king's truest subjects? and what head
it is that denominateth the kingdom? and who are
the traitors? This is your case.</p>

<p>2. Divisions are the deformities of the church.
Cut off a nose, or pluck out an eye, or dismember
either a man or a picture, and see whether you have
not deformed it. Ask any compassionate christian,
ask any insulting enemy, whether our divisions be
not our deformity and shame, the lamentation of
friends, and the scorn of enemies?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">{604}</a></span>
3. The church's divisions are not our own dishonour
alone, but the injurious dishonour of Christ,
and religion, and the gospel. The world thinketh
that Christ is an impotent king, that cannot keep his
kingdom at unity in itself, when he hath himself
told us, that "every kingdom divided against itself
is brought to desolation, and every city or house
divided against itself shall not stand," Matt. xii. 25.
They think the gospel tendeth to division, and is a
doctrine of dissension, when they see divisions and
dissensions procured by it; they impute all the faults
of the subjects to the King, and think that Christ was
confused in his legislation, and knew not what to
teach or command, because men are confounded in
their opinions or practices, and know not what to
think or do. If men misunderstand the law of
Christ, and one saith, This is the sense, and another
saith, That is the sense, they are ready to think that
Christ spake nonsense, or understood not himself,
because the ignorant understand him not: who is
there that converseth with the ungodly of the world,
that heareth not by their reproach and scorns how
much God and religion are dishonoured by the
divisions of religious people?</p>

<p>4. And thus also our divisions do lamentably hinder
the progress of the gospel, and the conversion
and salvation of the ungodly world: they think they
have small encouragement to be of your religion,
while your divisions seem to tell them, that you
know not what religion to be of yourselves. Whatever
Satan or wicked men would say against religion
to discourage the ungodly from it, the same will exasperated
persons in these divisions say against each
other's way; and when every one of you condemneth
another, how should the consciences of the ungodly
persuade them to accept salvation in any of those
ways, which you thus condemn? Doubtless the
divisions of the christian world have done more to
hinder the conversion of infidels, and keep the heathen
and Mahometan world in their damnable ignorance
and delusions, than all our power is able to
undo; and have produced such desolations of the
church of Christ, and such a plentiful harvest and
kingdom for the devil, as every tender christian
heart is bound to lament with tears of bitterness.
If it must be that such offences shall come, yet woe
to those by whom they come!</p>

<p>5. Divisions lay open the churches of Christ,
not only to the scorn, but to the malice, will, and
fury of their enemies. A kingdom or house divided
cannot stand, Matt. xii. 25. Where hath the church
been destroyed, or religion rooted out, in any nation
of the earth, but divisions had a principal hand in
the effect? Oh what desolations have they made
among the flocks of Christ! As Seneca and others
opened their veins and bled to death, when Nero
or such other tyrants did send them their commands
to die; even so have many churches done
by their divisions, to the gratifying of Satan, the
enemy of souls.</p>

<p>6. Divisions among christians do greatly hinder
the edification of the members of the church; while
they are possessed with envyings and distaste of one
another, they lose all the benefit of each other's gifts,
and of that holy communion which they should have
with one another.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_154" id="Ref_154" href="#Foot_154">[154]</a></span>
And they are possessed with that
zeal and wisdom, which James calleth earthly, sensual,
and devilish, which corrupteth all their affections,
and turneth their food to the nourishment of
their disease, and maketh their very worshipping of
God to become the increase of their sin. Where
divisions and contentions are, the members that
should grow up in humility, meekness, self-denial,
holiness, and love, do grow in pride, and perverse
disputings, and passionate strivings, and envious
wranglings; the Spirit of God departeth from them,
and an evil spirit of malice and vexation taketh
place; though, in their passion, they know not what
spirit they are of: whereas if they be of one mind,
and live in peace, the God of love and peace will be
with them. What lamentable instances of this calamity
have we in many of the sectaries of this present
time; especially in the people called quakers,
that while they pretend to the greatest austerities,
do grow up to such a measure of sour pride, and uncharitable
contempt of others, and especially of all
superiors, and hellish railing against the holiest
ministers and people, as we have scarce known or
ever read of.</p>

<p>7. These divisions fill the church with sin, even
with sins of a most odious nature. They introduce
a swarm of errors, while it becomes the mode for
every one to have a doctrine of his own, and to have
something to say in religion which may make him
notable. "Of your own selves shall men arise,
speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples
after them," Acts xx. 30. They cherish pride, and
malice, and belying others, (the three great sins of
the devil,) as naturally as dead flesh breedeth worms;
they destroy impartial, christian love, as naturally
as bleeding doth consume our vital heat and moisture.
What wickedness is it that they will not cherish?
In a word, <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>The Greek word is zeal.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>the Scripture telleth us that "where
envying and strife is, there is confusion, and every evil work." (And
is not this a lamentable way of reformation of some imaginary or
lesser evils?)</p>

<p>8. These divisions are the grief of honest spectators,
and cause the sorrows of those that are guilty
of them. They make all their duties uneasy to them,
and turn their religion into a bitter, unpleasant,
wrangling toil; like oxen in the yoke that strive
against each other, when they should draw in order
and equality. What a grievous life is it to husband
and wife, or any in the family, if they live in discord?
So is it to the members of the church. When
once men take the kingdom of God to consist of
meats, or drinks, or ceremonies, which consisteth in
righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,
and turn to strive about unedifying questions, they
turn from all the sweetness of religion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_155" id="Ref_155" href="#Foot_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Sects and divisions lead directly to apostasy
from the faith. Nothing is more in the design of
Satan, than to confound men so with variety of religions,
that they may think there is no certainty in
any; that so both the ignorant spectators may think
all religion is but fancy and deceit, and the contenders
themselves wheel about from sect to sect, till
they come to the point where they first set out, and to
be at last deliberately of no religion, who at first were
of none for want of deliberation. And it is no small
success that Satan hath had by this temptation.</p>

<p>10. The divisions of christians do oft proceed to
shake states and kingdoms, having a lamentable influence
upon the civil peace; and this stirreth up
princes' jealousies against them, and to the use of
those severities, which the suffering party takes for
persecution; yea, and Turks, and all princes that
are enemies to reformation and holiness, do justify
themselves in their cruelest persecutions, when they
see the divisions of christians, and the troubles of
states that have followed thereupon. If christians,
and protestants in special, did live in that unity,
peace, and order as their Lord and Ruler requireth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">{605}</a></span>
them to do, the consciences of persecutors would
even worry and torment them, and make their lives
a hell on earth, for their cruelty against so excellent
a sort of men; but now when they see them all in
confusions, and see the troubles that follow hereupon,
and hear them reviling one another, they think they
may destroy them as the troublers of the earth, and
their consciences scarce accuse them for it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The aggravations of schism.</div>

<p>IV. It is necessary also for your
true understanding the malignity of
this sin, that you take notice of the
aggravations of it, especially as to us. 1. It is a sin
against so many, and clear, and vehement words of
the Holy Ghost, (which I have partly before recited,)
that it is therefore utterly without excuse:
whoredoms, and treasons, and perjury are not oftener
forbidden in the gospel than this.</p>

<p>2. It is contrary to the design of Christ in our redemption;
which was to reconcile us all to God, and
unite and centre us all in him: "To gather together
in one the children of God that are scattered abroad,"
John xi. 52. "To gather together in one all things
in Christ," Eph. i. 10. "To make in himself of
twain one new man, so making peace," Eph. ii. 15.
And shall we join with Satan the divider and destroyer,
against Christ the reconciler, in the very
design of his redemption?</p>

<p>3. It is contrary to the design of the Spirit of
grace, and contrary to the very nature of christianity
itself. "By one Spirit we are all baptized into one
body&mdash;and have all been made to drink into one
Spirit," 1&nbsp;Cor. xii. 13. "As there is one body and
one Spirit, so it is our charge to keep the unity of
the Spirit in the bond of peace," Eph. iv. 3, 4. The
new nature of christians doth consist in love, and
desireth the communion of saints as such; and therefore
the command of this special love is called the
new commandment, John xvii. 21; xiii. 34; xv.
12, 17. And they are said to be taught of God to
love one another, 1&nbsp;Thess. iv. 9. As self-preservation
is the chief principle in the natural body, which
causeth it to abhor the wounding or amputation of
its members, and to avoid division as destruction,
except when a gangrened member must be cut off,
for the saving of the body; so it is also with the
mystical body of Christ. He is senseless and graceless
that abhorreth not church wounds.</p>

<p>4. These divisions are sins against the nearest
bonds of our high relations to each other:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_156" id="Ref_156" href="#Foot_156">[156]</a></span>
"We
are brethren, and should there be any strife among
us?" Gen. xiii. 8. "We are all the children of
God by faith in Christ Jesus," Gal. iii. 26. We are
the fellow-members of the body of Christ; and should
we tear his body, and separate his members, and cut
his flesh, and break his bones? Eph. v. 23, 30.
"For as the body is one, and hath many members,
and all the members of that one body being many,
are one body, so also is Christ," 1&nbsp;Cor. xii. 12. "As
we have many members in one body&mdash;so we being
many are one body in Christ; and every one members
one of another," Rom. xii. 4, 5. He that woundeth
or dismembereth your own bodies, shall scarce
be taken for your friend; and are you Christ's friends,
when you dismember or wound his body?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_157" id="Ref_157" href="#Foot_157">[157]</a></span>
Is it
lovely to see the children or servants in your family
together by the ears? Are civil wars for the safety of
a kingdom? Or doth that tend to the honour of the
children of God, which is the shame of common
men? Or is that the safety of his kingdom, which
is the ruin of all others? "We are all fellow-citizens
with the saints, and of the household of God,"
Eph. ii. 19. "We are God's building," 1&nbsp;Cor. iii.
9. "Know ye not that ye are the temple of God;
and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? If any
man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy:
for the temple of God is holy, which temple
ye are," 1&nbsp;Cor. iii. 16, 17. Will he destroy the defilers,
and will he love the dividers and destroyers?
If it be so great a sin to go to law unnecessarily with
our brethren, or to wrong them, 1&nbsp;Cor. vi. 8, what
is it to disown them, and cast them off? And if
they that salute and love only their brethren, and
not also their enemies, are not the children of God,
Matt. v. 47, what are they that separate from and
condemn even their brethren?</p>

<p>5. Church dividers either would divide Christ
himself between them, or else would rob him of a
great part of his inheritance: and neither of these
is a little sin. If you make several bodies, you would
have several heads; and is Christ divided? saith the
apostle, 1&nbsp;Cor. i. 13. Will you make him a sect-master?
He will be your common head as christians;
but he will be no head of your sects and parties.
(I will not name them.) Or would you tear
out of the hands of Christ any part of his possessions?
Will he cut them off, because you cut them
off? Will he separate them from himself, because
you separate from them, or separate them from you?
Will he give them a bill of divorce, whenever you
are pleased to lay any odious accusation against
them? Who shall condemn them, when it is he
that justifieth them? Who shall separate them from
the love of God? Can your censure or separation
do it, when neither life, nor death, nor any creature
can do it? Rom. viii. 33, &amp;c. Hath he not told you,
that "he will give them eternal life, and they shall
never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of his
hand?" John x. 28. Will he lose his jewels, because
you cast them away as dirt? He suffered more for
souls than you, and better knoweth the worth of
souls! And do you think that he will forget so dear
a purchase? or take it well that you rob him of that
which he hath bought so dearly? Will you give
the members and inheritance of Christ to the devil,
and say, They are Satan's, and none of Christ's?
"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?"</p>

<p>6. Church dividers are guilty of self-ignorance,
and pride, and great unthankfulness against that God
that beareth with so much in them, who so censoriously
cast off their brethren. Wert thou ever humbled
for thy sin? Dost thou know who thou art,
and what thou carriest about thee, and how much
thou offendest God thyself? If thou do, surely thou
wilt judge tenderly of thy brethren, as knowing what
a tender hand thou needest, and what mercy thou
hast found from God. Can he cruelly judge his
brethren to hell upon his petty differences, who is
sensible how the gracious hand of his Redeemer did
so lately snatch him from the brink of hell? Can
he be forward to condemn his brethren, that hath
been so lately and mercifully saved himself?</p>

<p>7. Church dividers are the most successful servants
of the devil, being enemies to Christ in his
family and livery. They gratify Satan, and all the
enemies of the church, and do the very work that he
would have them do, more effectually than open enemies
could do it. As mutineers in an army may do
more to destroy it, than the power of the enemy.</p>

<p>8. It is a sin that contradicteth all God's ordinances
and means of grace; which are purposely to
procure and maintain the unity of his church. The
word and baptism is to gather them into one body,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">{606}</a></span>
and the Lord's supper to signify and maintain their
concord, as being one bread, and one body, 1&nbsp;Cor. x.
17. And all the communion of the church is to express
and to maintain this concord. The use of the
ministry is much to this end, to be the bonds and
joints of this unity of believers, Eph. iv. 13, 14, 16.
All these are contemned and frustrated by dividers.</p>

<p>9. Church division is a sin (especially to us)
against as great and lamentable experiences as almost
any sin can be. About sixteen hundred years
the church hath smarted by it. In many countries
where the gospel prospered, and churches flourished,
division hath turned all into desolation, and delivered
them up to the curse of Mahometanism and
infidelity. The contentions between Constantinople
and Rome, the eastern and the western churches, have
shaken the christian interest upon earth, and delivered
up much of the christian world to tyranny
and blindness, and given advantage to the papacy to
captivate and corrupt much of the rest, by pretending
itself to be the centre of unity. Oh what glorious
churches, where the learned writers of those ages
once lived, are now extinct, and the places turned to
the worship of the devil and a deceiver, through the
ambition and contentions of the bishops, that should
have been the bonds of their unity and peace! But
doth England need to look back into history, or look
abroad in foreign lands, for instances of the sad
effects of discord? Is there any one, good or bad, in
this age, that hath spent his days in such a sleep, as
not to know what divisions have done, when they
have made such ruins in church and state, and
kindled such consuming flames, and raised so many
sects and parties, and filled so many hearts with uncharitable
rancour, and so many mouths with slanders
and revilings, and turned so many prayers into
sin, by poisoning them with pride and factious oppositions,
and hath let out streams of blood and fury
over all the land? He that maketh light of the divisions
of christians in these kingdoms, or loveth not
those that speak against them, doth show himself to
be so impenitent in them, as to be one of those terrible
effects of them, that should be a pillar of salt to
warn after-ages to take heed.</p>

<p>10. Yea, this is a heinous aggravation of this sin,
that commonly it is justified, and not repented of, by
those that do commit it. When a drunkard or a
whoremonger will confess his sin, a church divider
will stand to it and defend it; and woe to them that
call evil good, and good evil! Impenitency is a
terrible aggravation of sin.</p>

<p>11. And it is yet the more heinous, in that it is
commonly fathered upon God. If a drunkard or
whoremonger should say, God commandeth me to do
it, and I serve God by it, would you not think this a
horrid aggravation? When did you ever know a
sect or party, how contrary soever among themselves,
but they all pretended God's authority, and
entitled him to their sin, and called it his service,
and censured others as ungodly, or less godly, that
would not do as bad as they? St. James is put to
confute them that thought this wisdom was from
above, and so did glory in their sin, and lie against
the truth, when their wisdom was from beneath, and
no better than earthly, sensual, and devilish. For
the "wisdom from above, is first pure, then peaceable,
gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy," &amp;c.
James iii. 17.</p>

<p>12. Church divisions are unlike to our heavenly
state, and in some regard worse than the kingdom
of the devil, for he would not destroy it by dividing
it against itself, Matt. xii. 26. Oh what a blessed
harmony of united holy souls, will there be in the
heavenly Jerusalem, where we hope to dwell for
ever! There will be no discords, envyings, sidings, or
contendings, one being of this party, and another of
that; but in the unity of perfect love, that world of
spirits with joyful praise will magnify their Creator.
And is a snarling envy or jarring discord the likely
way to such an end? Is the church of Christ a
Babel of confusion? Should they be divided, party
against party, here, that must be one in perfect love
for ever?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_158" id="Ref_158" href="#Foot_158">[158]</a></span>
Shall they here be condemning each other,
as none of the children of the Most High, who there
must live in sweetest concord? If there be shame in
heaven, you will be ashamed to meet those in the delights
of glory, and see them entertained by the Lord
of love, whom you reviled and cast out of the church
or your communion, causelessly, on earth.</p>

<p>Remember now that schism, and making parties
and divisions in the church, is not so small a sin as
many take it for: it is the accounting it a duty, and
a part of holiness, which is the greatest cause that it
prospereth in the world; and it will never be reformed
till men have right apprehensions of the evil
of it. Why is it that sober people are so far and
free from the sins of swearing, drunkenness, fornication,
and lasciviousness, but because these sins are
under so odious a character, as helpeth them easily
to perceive the evil of them. And till church divisions
be rightly apprehended, as whoredom, and
swearing, and drunkenness are, they will never be
well cured. Imprint therefore on your minds the
true character of them, which I have here laid down,
and look abroad upon the effects, and then you
will fear this confounding sin, as much as a consuming
plague.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Two hinderances of our true apprehensions of schism.</div>

<p>The two great causes that keep
divisions from being hated as they
ought, are, 1. A charitable respect to
the good that is in church dividers, carrying us to
overlook the evil of the sin; judging of it by the
persons that commit it, and thinking that nothing
should seem odious that is theirs, because many of
them are in other respects of blameless, pious conversations.
And indeed every christian must so prudently
reprehend the mistakes and faults of pious
men, as not to asperse the piety which is conjunct;
and therefore not to make their persons odious, but
to give the person all his just commendations for his
piety, while we oppose and aggravate his sin; because
Christ himself so distinguisheth between the
good and the evil, and the person and the sin, and
loveth his own for their good while he hateth their
evil; and so must we; and because it is the grand
design of Satan, by the faults of the godly to make
their persons hated first, and their piety next, and so
to banish religion from the world; and every friend
of Christ must show himself an enemy to this design
of Satan. But yet the sin must be disowned and opposed,
while the person is loved according to his
worth. Christ will give no thanks for such love to
his children, as cherisheth their church-destroying
sins. There is no greater enemy to sin than Christ,
though there be no greater friend to souls. Godliness
was never intended to be a fortress for iniquity;
or a battery for the devil to mount his cannons on
against the church; nor for a blind to cover the
powder-mines of hell. Satan never opposeth truth,
and godliness, and unity so dangerously, as when he
can make religious men his instruments. Remember
therefore that all men are vanity, and God's interest
and honour must not be sacrificed to theirs, nor the
Most Holy be abused, in reverence to the holiest of
sinful men.</p>

<p>The other great hinderance of our due apprehension
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">{607}</a></span>
of the sinfulness of divisions, is our too deep sense
of our sufferings by superiors, and our looking so
much at the evil of persecutions, as not to look at
the danger of the contrary extreme. Thus under the
papacy, the people of Germany at Luther's reformation
were so deeply sensible of the papal cruelties,
that they thought by how many ways soever men
fled from such bloody persecutors, they were very
excusable. And while men were all taken up in
decrying the Roman idolatry, corruptions, and cruelties,
they never feared the danger of their own divisions
till they smarted by them. And this was once
the case of many good people here in England, who
so much hated the wickedness of the profane and
the haters of godliness, that they had no apprehensions
of the evil of divisions among themselves: and
because so many profane ones were wont to call
sober, godly people, schismatics and factious, therefore
the very names began with many to grow into
credit, as if they had been of good signification, and
there had been really no such sin as schism and faction
to be feared: till God permitted this sin to break
in upon us with such fury, as had almost turned us
into a Babel, and a desolation. And I am persuaded
God did purposely permit it, to teach his people more
sensibly to know the evil of that sin by the effects,
which they would not know by other means: and to
let them see when they had reviled and ruined each
other, that there is that in themselves which they
should be more afraid of, than of any enemy without.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Own not any cause which is an enemy
to love; and pretend neither truth, nor holiness, nor
unity, nor order, nor any thing against it.<span

The
spirit of love is that one vital spirit which doth animate
all the saints. The increase of love is the
powerful balsam that healeth all the church's wounds;
though loveless, lifeless physicians think that all
these wounds must be healed by the sword. And
indeed the weapon-salve is now become the proper
cure. It is the sword that must be medicated, that
the wounds made by it may be healed. The decays
of love are the church's dissolution; which first
causeth scissures and separations, and in process
crumbleth us all to dust: and therefore the pastors
of the church are the fittest instruments for the cure,
who are the messengers of love, and whose government
is paternal, and hurteth not the body; but is
only a government of love, and exercised by all the
means of love. All christians in the world confess
that love is the very life and perfection of all grace,
and the end of all our other duties, and that which
maketh us like to God; and that if love dwelleth in
us, God dwelleth in us; and that it will be the everlasting
grace, and the work of heaven, and the happiness
of souls; and that it is the excellent way,
and the character of saints, and the new commandment.
And all this being so, it is most certain that
no way is the way of God, which is not the way of
love; and therefore what specious pretences soever
they may have, and one may cry up truth, and another
holiness, and another order, and another unity
itself, to justify their envyings, hatred, cruelties, it
is most certain that all such pretences are satanical
deceits.<span

And if they bite and devour one another,
they are not like the sheep of Christ, but shall be
devoured one of another, Gal. v. 15. "Love worketh
no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling
of the law," Rom. xiii. 10. When papists that
show their love to men's souls by racking their bodies,
and frying them in the fire, can make them apprehensive
of the excellency of that kind of love, they
may use it to the healing of the church. In the
mean time as their religion is, such is their concord,
while all those are called members of their union,
and professors of their religion, who must be burnt
to ashes if they say the contrary. They that give
God an image and carcass of religion, are thus content
with the image and carcass of a church for the
exercise of it. And if there were nothing else but
this to detect the sinfulness of the sect of quakers,
and many more, it is enough to satisfy any sober
man, that it cannot be the way of God. God is not
the author of that spirit and way which tends to
wrath, emulation, hatred, railing, and the extinction
of christian love, to all save their own sect and party.
Remember, as you love your souls, that you shun all
ways that are destructive to universal christian love.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Make nothing necessary to the unity
of the church, or the communion of christians, which
God hath not made necessary, or directed you to
make so.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_161" id="Ref_161" href="#Foot_161">[161]</a></span>
By this one folly, the papists are become
the most notorious schismatics on earth; even by
making new articles of faith, and new parts of worship,
and imposing them on all christians, to be
sworn, subscribed, professed, or practised, so as that
no man shall be accounted a catholic, or have communion
with them, (or with the universal church, if
they could hinder it,) that will not follow them in
all their novelties. They that would subscribe to
all the Scriptures, and to all the ancient creeds of
the church, and would do any thing that Christ
and his apostles have enjoined, and go every step
of that way to heaven that Peter and Paul went, as
far as they are able, yet if they will go no further,
and believe no more, (yea, if they will not go against
some of this,) must be condemned, cast out, and called
schismatics by these notorious schismatics. If
he hold to Christ the universal Head of the church,
and will not be subject or sworn to the pope, the
usurping head, he shall be taken as cut off from
Christ. And there is no certainty among these men
what measure of faith, and worship, and obedience
to them, shall be judged necessary to constitute a
church member: for as that which served in the
apostles' days, and the following ages, will not serve
now, nor the subscribing to all the other pretended
councils until then will not serve without subscribing
to the creed or council of Trent; so nobody can tell,
what new faith, or worship, or test of christianity,
the next council (if the world see any more) may
require: and how many thousand that are Trent
catholics now, may be judged heretics or schismatics
then, if they will not shut their eyes, and follow
them any whither, and change their religion as oft as
the papal interest requireth a change. Of this Chillingworth,
Hales, and Dr. H. More have spoken
plainly.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_162" id="Ref_162" href="#Foot_162">[162]</a></span>
If the pope had imposed but one lie to be
subscribed, or one sin to be done, and said "All nations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">{608}</a></span>
and persons that do not this, are no christians,
or shall have no communion with the church," the
man that refuseth that imposed lie or sin, is guiltless
of the schism, and doth but obey God, and save his
soul; and the usurper that imposeth them, will be
found the heinous schismatic before God, and the
cause of all those divisions of the church. And so
if any private sectary shall feign an opinion or
practice of his own to be necessary to salvation or
church communion, and shall refuse communion with
those that are not of his mind and way, it is he, and
not they, that is the cause of the uncharitable
separation.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Pray against the usurpations or intrusions
of impious, carnal, ambitious, covetous pastors
into the churches of Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_163" id="Ref_163" href="#Foot_163">[163]</a></span>
For one wicked man
in the place of a pastor, may do more to the increase
of a schism or faction, than many private men can
do. And carnal men have carnal minds and carnal
interests, which are both unreconcilable to the spiritual,
holy mind and interest; for the "carnal mind
is enmity against God, and is not subject to his law,
nor can be," Rom. viii. 7. "And they that are in the
flesh cannot please God," ver. 8. And you may
easily conceive what work will be made in the ship,
when an enemy of the owner hath subtilly possessed
himself of the pilot's place! He will charge all that
are faithful as mutineers, because they resist him
when he would carry all away. And if an enemy of
Christ shall get to be governor of one of his regiments
or garrisons, all that are not traitors shall be
called traitors, and cashiered, that they hinder not
the treason which he intendeth. And "as then he
that was born after the flesh, persecuted him that
was born after the Spirit, even so it is now: but
what saith the Scripture? Cast out the bondwoman
and her son," &amp;c. Gal. iv. 29, 30. It is not the sacred
office of the ministry, nor the profession of the
same religion, that will cure the enmity of a carnal
heart, against both holiness and the holy seed. The
whole business of the world from age to age is but
the management of that war, proclaimed at sin's first
entrance into the world, between the seed of the woman
and the serpent, Gen. iii. 15; and none of the serpent's
seed are more cruel or more successful, than those
of them that creep into the armies of Christ; and
especially that get the conduct of his regiments.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_164" id="Ref_164" href="#Foot_164">[164]</a></span>
Neither brotherhood nor unity of professed religion,
would hold the hands of malignant Cain from murdering
his brother Abel. The same religion, and
father, and family reconciled not scoffing Ishmael to
Isaac, or profane Esau to his brother Jacob. The
family of Christ, and an apostle's office, did not keep
Judas from being a traitor to his Lord. If carnal
men invade the ministry, they take the way of ease,
and honour, and worldly wealth, and strive for dominion,
and who shall be the greatest, and care not
how great their power and jurisdiction are, nor how
little their profitable work is; and their endeavour
is to fit all matters of worship and discipline to their
ambitious, covetous ends; and the spiritual worshipper
shall be the object of their hate: and is it any
wonder if the churches of Christ be torn by schism,
and betrayed to profaneness, where there are such
unhappy guides?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_165" id="Ref_165" href="#Foot_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. In a special manner, take heed of
pride; suspect it and subdue it in yourselves, and
do what you can to bring it into disgrace with others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_166" id="Ref_166" href="#Foot_166">[166]</a></span>
"Only by pride cometh contention," Prov. xiii. 10. I
never yet saw one schism made, in which pride conjunct
with ignorance was not the cause: nor ever
did I know one person forward in a schism, (to my
remembrance,) but pride was discernibly his disease.
I do not here intend (as the papists) to charge all
with schism or pride, that renounce not their understandings,
and choose not to give up themselves to a
bestial subjection to usurpers or their pastors: he
that thinks it enough that his teacher hath reason
and be a man, instead of himself, and so thinketh it
enough that his teacher be a christian and religious;
must be also content that his teacher alone be saved:
(but then he must not be the teacher of such a damning
way:) but by pride I mean a plain overvaluing
of his own understanding, and conceits and reasonings,
quite above all the evidences of their worth,
and an undervaluing and contempt of the judgments
and reasonings of far wiser men, that had evidence
enough to have evinced his folly and error to a sober
and impartial man. Undoubtedly it is the pride of
priests and people, that hath so lamentably in all
ages torn the church. He that readeth the histories
of schisms and church confusions, and marketh the
effects which this age hath showed, will no more
doubt whether pride were the cause, than whether
it was the wind that blew down trees and houses,
when he seeth them one way overturned by multitudes,
where the tempest came with greatest force.
Therefore a bishop must be "no novice, lest being
lifted up with pride (<span title="hina mê typhôtheis">ἵνα μὴ τυφωθεὶς</span>)
he fall into the
condemnation of the devil," 1&nbsp;Tim. iii. 6. And if
such stars fall from heaven, no wonder if they bring
many down headlong with them. Humble souls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">{609}</a></span>
dwell most at home, and think themselves unworthy
of the communion of their brethren, and are most
quarrelsome against their own corruptions. "They
do nothing in strife and vain-glory, but in lowliness
of mind each one esteemeth other better than themselves,"
Phil. ii. 2, 3; and "judge not lest they be
judged," Matt. vi. 1. And is it likely such should
be dividers of the church? But proud men must
either be great and domineer, and as Diotrephes,
3&nbsp;John 9, 10, love to have the pre-eminence, and
cast the brethren out of the church, and prate against
their faithfullest pastors with malicious words; or
else must be noted for their supposed excellencies,
and set up themselves, and speak perverse things, to
draw away disciples after them, Acts xx. 30; and
think the brethren unworthy of their communion,
and esteem all others below themselves; and, as the
church of Rome, confound communion and subjection,
and think none fit for their communion that
obey them not, or comply not with their opinion and
will. There is no hope of concord where pride hath
power to prevail.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Take heed of singularity, and narrowness
of mind, and unacquaintedness with the former
and present state of the church and world. Men
that are bred up in a corner, and never read nor heard
of the common condition of the church or world, are
easily misled into schism, through ignorance of
those matters of fact that would preserve them.
Abundance of this sort of honest people that I have
known, have known so little beyond the town or
country where they lived, that they have thought
they were very catholic in their communion, because
they had one or two congregations, and divided not
among themselves. But for the avoiding of schism,
1. Look (with pity) on the unbelieving world, and
consider that christians of all sorts are but a sixth
part of the whole earth. And then, 2. Consider of
this sixth part how small a part the reformed
churches are. And if you be willing to leave Christ
any church at all, perhaps you will be loth to separate
yet into a narrower party, which is no more to
all the world, than one of your cottages is to the
whole kingdom. And is this all the kingdom on
earth that you will ascribe to Christ? Is the King
of the church, the King only of your little party?
Though his flock be but a little flock, make it not
next to none; as if he came into the world on so
low a design as the gathering of your sect only.
The less his flock is, the more sinful it is to rob him
of it, and make it lesser than it is. It is a little flock,
if it contained all the christians, protestants, Greeks,
Armenians, Abassines, and papists on the earth. Be
singular and separate from the unbelieving world, and
spare not; and be singular in holiness from profane
and nominal hypocritical christians; but affect not
to be singular in opinion or practice, or separated
in communion, from the universal church, or generality
of sound believers: or if you forsake some
common error, yet hold still the common love and
communion with all the faithful, according to your
opportunities. 3. And it will be very useful when
you are tempted to separate from any church for the defectiveness
of its manner of worship, to inquire how
God is worshipped in all the churches on earth, and
then consider, whether if you lived among them
you would forsake communion with them all, for
such defects (while you are not forced to justify or
approve them).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_167" id="Ref_167" href="#Foot_167">[167]</a></span>
4. And it is very useful to read
church history, and to understand what heresies
have been in times past, and what havoc schisms
have caused among christians: for if this much had
been known by well meaning persons in our days,
we should not have seen those same opinions applauded
as new light, which were long ago exploded
as old heresies: nor should we have seen many
honest people, taking that same course to reform the
church now, and advance the gospel, which in so
many ages and nations hath heretofore destroyed
the church, and cast out the gospel. A narrow soul,
that taketh all Christ's interest in the world, to lie
in a few of their separated meetings, and shutteth
up all the church in a nutshell, must needs be guilty
of the foulest schisms. It is a catholic spirit and
catholic principles, loving a christian as a christian,
abhorring the very names of sects and parties as the
church's wounds, that must make a catholic indeed.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Understand well the true difference between
the visible church and the world, lest you
should think that you are bound to separate as much
from a corrupted church as from the world. It is
not true faith, but the profession of true faith, that
maketh a man fit to be acknowledged a member of
the visible church. If this profession be unsound,
and accompanied with a vicious life, it is the sin and
misery of such a hypocrite, but it doth not presently
put him as far unrelated to you, as if he were an infidel
without the church! If you ask what advantage
have such unsound church members? I answer
with the apostle, Rom. iii. 1, 2, "Much every way,
chiefly because unto them are committed the oracles
of God." Chap. ix. 4, "To them pertaineth the
adoption and the glory and covenants, and the giving
of the law, and the service of God, and the promises."
Till the church find cause to cast them out, they have
the external privileges of its communion. It hath
made abundance to incur the guilt of sinful separation
to misunderstand those texts of Scripture that
call christians to separate from heathens, infidels,
and idolaters: as 2&nbsp;Cor. vi. 17, "Wherefore come
out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the
Lord," &amp;c. The text speaketh only of separating
from the world who are infidels and idolaters, and
no members of the church; and ignorant people ordinarily
expound it, as if it were meant of separating
from the church because of the ungodly that are
members of it: but that God that knew why he called
his people to separate from the world, doth never
call them to separate from the church universal,
nor from any particular church by a mental separation
so as to unchurch them. We read of many
loathsome corruptions in the churches of Corinth,
Galatia, Laodicea, &amp;c.; but yet no command to separate
from them. So many abuse Rev. xviii. 4,
"Come out of her, my people;" as if God commanded
them to come out of a true church because of its
corruptions or imperfections, because he calleth
them out of Babylon! It is true, you must partake
with no church in their sins, but you may partake
with any church in their holy profession and worship,
so far as you can do it without partaking with
them in their sins.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. Understand what it is that maketh
you partakers of the sins of a church, or any member
of it, lest you think you are bound to separate from
them in good, as well as in evil. Many fly from the
public assemblies, lest they partake of the sins of
those that are there present. Certainly nothing but
consent (direct or indirect) can make their faults to
become yours. And therefore nothing which signifieth
not some such consent should be on that account
avoided. 1. If you by word, or subscription,
or furtherance, own any man's sin, you directly consent
to it. 2. If you neglect any duty which lieth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">{610}</a></span>
upon you for the cure of his sin, you indirectly consent;
for you consent that he shall rather continue
in his sin, than you will do your part to help him
out of it. Consider therefore how far you are bound
to reprove any sin, or to use any other means for the
reformation of it, whether it be in the pastor or the
people; and if you neglect any such means, your
way is to reform your own neglect, and do your duty,
and not to separate from the church, before you
have done your duty to reform it. But if you have
done all that is your part, then the sin is none of
yours, though you remain there present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether presence be not a consent to sin.</div>

<p>It is a turbulent fancy and disquieting
error of some people, to
think that their presence in the assembly,
and continuance with the church, doth make
them guilty of the personal faults of those they join
with: if so, who would ever join with any assembly
in the world? <i>Quest.</i> But what if they be gross and
scandalous sinners that are members of the church?
<i>Answ.</i> If you be wanting in your duty to reform it,
it is your sin; but if bare presence made their sins
to be ours, it would also make all the sins of the assembly
ours; but no word of God doth intimate any
such thing. Paul never told the churches of Galatia
and Corinth so, that had so many defiled members.
<i>Quest.</i> But what if they are sins committed in the
open assembly, even by the minister himself in his
praying, preaching, and other administrations? and
what if all this be imposed on him by a law, and so
I am certain beforehand that I must join with that
which is unwarrantable in God's worship? <i>Answ.</i>
The next direction containeth those distinctions
that are necessary to the answer of this.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. Distinguish carefully, 1. Between a
minister's personal faults and his ministerial faults.
2. Between his tolerable weaknesses and his intolerable
insufficiencies. 3. And between the work
of the minister and of the congregation. And then
you will see your doubt resolved in these following
propositions.</p>

<p>1. A minister's personal faults (as swearing, lying,
drunkenness, &amp;c.) may damn himself, and must be
matter of lamentation to the church, and they must
do their best to reform them, or to get a better pastor
by any lawful means.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_168" id="Ref_168" href="#Foot_168">[168]</a></span>
But in case they cannot,
his sin is none of theirs, nor doth it make his administration
null or ineffectual; nor will it allow you
to separate from the worship which he administereth.
Though many of the priests were wicked men, the
godly Jews were not thereby disobliged from God's
public worship, or sacrifices which were to be offered
by their hands. Otherwise how sad a case were the
church in, that must answer for the sins which they
never committed, nor could reform. But no Scripture
chargeth this upon them.</p>

<p>2. It is not all ministerial faults that will allow
you to separate from or disown a minister; but only
those that prove him or his ministration utterly intolerable.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_169" id="Ref_169" href="#Foot_169">[169]</a></span>
Such are, 1. An utter insufficiency in
knowledge or utterance for the necessary parts of the
ministerial work: as if he be not able to teach the
necessary points of the christian religion, nor to administer
the sacraments and other parts of public
worship. 2. If he set himself to oppose the very
ends of his ministry, and preach down godliness, or
any part of it that is of necessity to salvation: for
then he doth the devil's work, in seeking the damnation
of souls, and so maketh himself the devil's minister,
and is not the minister of Christ: for the end
is essential to the relation. Herein I include a
preacher of heresy that doth preach up any damning
error, and preach down any necessary saving truth;
that is, that preacheth such error as subverteth either
faith or godliness, and doth more harm in the church
than good. 3. If he so deprave God's public worship
as to destroy the substance of it, and make it
unacceptable, and offer up a public false worship to
God, which he disowneth in the very matter of it.
As if he put up blasphemy for praise and prayer, or
commit idolatry, or set up new sacraments, and guide
the people thus in public worship. As the papist
priests do that adore bread with divine worship, and
pray to the dead, and offer real sacrifices for them,
&amp;c.: such worship is not to be joined in. 4. Or if
they impose any actual sin upon the people: as in
their responds to speak any falsehood, or to adore
the bread, or the like: these faults discharge us from
being present with such pastors at such worship.
But besides these there are many ministerial faults
which warrant not our separation. As, 1. The internal
vices of the pastor's mind though manifested in
their ministration: as some tolerable errors of
judgment, or envy and pettish opposition to others.
"Some indeed preach Christ of envy and strife, and
some of good will: the one preach Christ of contention,
not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my
bonds; but the other of love," &amp;c. Phil. i. 15. Here
is an odious vice in the public ministry, even an endeavour
to increase the sufferings of the apostle;
yet it was lawful to hear such preachers; though not
to prefer them before better. Most sects among
christians are possessed with a tang of envy and uncharitableness
against dissenters, which useth to
break forth in their preaching and praying: and yet
it is lawful to join with such. 2. It is not unlawful
to join with a minister that hath many defects and
infirmities in his ministration or manner of worship:
as if he preach with some ignorance, disorder, unfit
expressions or gestures, unmeet repetitions; or if he
do the like in prayer, or in the sacraments, putting
something last that should be first, and leaving out
something that should be said, or praying coldly and
formally. These and such like are faults which we
should do our best to reform; and we should not
prefer such a ministry before a better; but it is lawful
and a duty to join with such, when we have no
better. For all men are imperfect, and therefore the
manner of worship as performed by them will be
imperfect. Imperfect men cannot be perfect in their
ministrations: we must join with a defective and imperfect
mode of worship, or join with none on earth:
and we must perform such or none ourselves. Which
of you dare say that in your private prayers, you
have no disorder, vain repetitions, flatness, or defects?
3. It is not unlawful to join with a minister
that hath some material error or untruth in his
preaching or praying, so be it we be not called to
approve it, or make it ours, and so it be not pernicious
and destructive to the ends of his ministry.
For all men have some error, and they that have
them may be expected sometimes to vent them. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">{611}</a></span>
it is not our presence that is any signification of our
consent to their mistakes. If we run away from all
that vent any untruth or mistake in public or private
worship, we shall scarce know what church or person
we may hold communion with: the reason of
this followeth.</p>

<p>3. The sense of the church, and all its members,
is to be judged of by their public professions, and
not by such words of a minister which are his own,
and never had their consent. I am by profession a
christian, and the Scripture is the professed rule of
my religion; and when I go to the assemblies, I
profess to worship God according to that rule: I
profess myself a hearer of a minister of the gospel,
that is to preach the word of God, and that hath
promised in his ordination, out of the holy Scriptures
to instruct the people committed to his charge,
and to teach nothing (as required of necessity to
eternal salvation) but that which he shall be persuaded
may be concluded and proved by the Scripture.
This he professed when he was ordained, and
I profess by my presence, only to hear such a
preacher of the gospel, and worship God with him
in those ordinances of worship, which God hath appointed.
Now if this man shall drop in any mistake
in preaching, or modify his prayers or administrations
amiss, and do his part weakly and disorderly,
the hearers are no way guilty of it by their presence.
For if I must run away from God's public
worship because of men's misperformance, 1. I
should join with none on earth; for a small sin may
no more be wilfully done or owned than a greater.
2. And then another man's weakness may disoblige
me and discharge me from my duty. To order and
word his prayers and preaching aright, is part of the
minister's own work, and not the people's; and if
he do it well, it is no commendation to me that am
present, but to himself; and therefore if he do it
amiss, it is no fault of mine or dispraise to me, but
to himself. If the common-council of London, or
the court of aldermen, agree to petition the king for
the renewing of their charter, and commit the expressing
of their request to their recorder, in their
presence; if he petition for something else instead
of that which he was intrusted with, and so betray
them in the substance of his business, they are
openly to contradict him and disown his treachery
or mistake; but if he deliver the same petition which
he undertook with stammering, disorder, defectiveness,
and perhaps some mixture of untruths in his
additional reasons and discourse, this is his failing in
the personal performance of his duty, and no way
imputable to them that sent him, and are present with
him, though (in modesty) they are silent and speak
not to disown it; for how can it be their fault that
a man is wanting in his personal sufficiency and duty
(unless it be that they choose not a better). And
whether he speak <i>ex tempore</i> or more deliberately, in
a written form or without, in words that other men
taught him or wrote for him, or in words of his
own devising, it altereth not their case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of imposed defective liturgies.</div>

<p><i>Object.</i> But if a man fail through
weakness in his own performance, I
know not of that beforehand; but if
his faulty manner of praying be prescribed and imposed
on him by a law, then I know it beforehand,
and therefore am guilty of it.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> To avoid confusion, fix upon that which
you think is the thing sinful. 1. Either it is because
the prayers are defective and faulty. 2. Or because
they are imposed. 3. Or because you know the
fault beforehand. But none of all these can prove
your joining with them sinful. 1. Not because they
are faulty; for you may join with as faulty prayers,
you confess, if not imposed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_170" id="Ref_170" href="#Foot_170">[170]</a></span>
2. Not because imposed,
(1.) Because that is an extenuation, and not
an aggravation: for it proveth the minister less
voluntary of the two than those are that do it without
any command, though the error of their own
judgments (as most erroneous persons will). (2.)
Because (though lawful things oft become unlawful
when superiors forbid them, yet) no reason can be
given why a lawful thing should become unlawful,
because a lawful superior doth command it. Else
superiors might take away all our christian liberty,
and make all things unlawful to us by commanding
them. You would take it for a wild conceit in your
children or servants, if they say, when you bid them
learn a catechism, or use a form of prayer, It was
lawful to us till you commanded us to do it; but because
you bid us do it, it is unlawful. If it be a duty
to obey governors in all lawful things, then it is not
a sin to obey them. 3. And it is not your knowing
beforehand that maketh it unlawful: for, 1. I know
in general beforehand, that all imperfect men will
do imperfectly; and though I know not the particular,
that maketh it never the lawfuller, if foreknowledge
itself did make it unlawful. 2. If you
know that e.&nbsp;g. an antinomian or some mistaken
preacher would constantly drop some words for his
error in prayer or preaching, that will not make it
unlawful in your own judgment for you to join, if it
be not a flat heresy. 3. It is another man's error or
fault that you foreknow, and not your own; and
therefore foreknowledge maketh it not your own.
4. God himself doth as an universal cause of nature
concur with men in those acts which he foreknoweth
they will sinfully do; and yet God is not to be
judged either an author or approver of the sin because
of such concurrence and foreknowledge: therefore
our foreknowledge maketh us no approvers, or
guilty of the failings of any in their sacred ministrations,
unless there be some other guilt. If you say
that it is no one of these that maketh it unlawful,
but all together, you must give us a distinct argument
to prove that the concurrence of these three
will prove that unlawful, which cannot be proved so
by any of them alone, for your affirmation must not
serve the turn; and when we know your argument,
I doubt not but it may be answered. One thing I
still confess may make any defective worship to be
unlawful to you; and that is, when you prefer it before
better, and may (without a greater inconvenience)
enjoy an abler ministry, and purer administration,
but will not.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But he that sitteth by in silence, in the
posture as the rest of the congregation, seemeth to
consent to all that is said and done: and we must
avoid all appearance of evil.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The appearance of evil which is evil indeed,
must be always avoided; but that appearance
of evil which is indeed good, must not be avoided.
We must not forsake our duty lest we seem to sin:
that were but to prefer hypocrisy before sincerity,
and to avoid appearances more than realities. The
omission of a duty is a real sin; and that must not
be done to avoid a seeming sin. And whom doth it
appear so to? If it appear evil to the blind or prejudiced,
it is their eyes that must be cured; but if it
appear so to the wise, then it is like it is evil indeed:
for a wise man should not judge that to be evil that
is not. But I confess that in a case that is altogether
indifferent, even the mistakes of the ignorant may
oblige us to forbear: but the worship of God must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">{612}</a></span>
not be so forborne. It is an irrational fancy to think
that you must be uncivil, by contradicting, or covering
your heads, or doing something offensive to the
congregation, when any thing is said or done which
you disallow. Your presence signifieth your consent
to all that you profess, even to worship God
according to his word, and not to all the human imperfections
that are there expressed.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. Distinguish carefully between your
personal private duties, and the duty of the pastor or
church with which you must concur. And do not
think, that if the church or pastor do not their duty,
that you are bound to do it for them. To cast out an
obstinate, impenitent sinner by sentence from the
communion of the church, is the pastor's or church's
duty, and not yours, unless in concurrence or subserviency
to the church. Therefore if it be not done,
inquire whether you did your duty towards it: if
you did, the sin is none of yours; for it is not in
your power to cast out all that are unworthy from
the church. But private familiarity is in your power
to refuse; and with such know not to eat.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Take the measure of your accidental
duties more from the good or hurt of the church, or
of many, than from the immediate good or hurt that
cometh to yourself. You are not to take that for the
station of your duty, which you feel to be most to
the commodity of your souls; but that in which you
may do God most service. If the service of God for
the good of many, require you to stay with a weaker
minister, and defective administrations, you will find
in the end that this was not only the place of your
duty, but also of your benefit: for your life is in
God's hands, and all your comforts; and that is the
best way to your peace and happiness, in which you
are most pleasing unto God, and have his promise of
most acceptance and grace. I know the least advantage
to the soul must be preferred before all earthly
riches; but not before the public good. Yea, that
way will prove most advantageous to us, in which
we exercise most obedience.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XV. Take heed of suffering prejudice and
fancy to go for reason, and raise in your minds unjustifiable
distastes of any way or mode of worship.
It is wonderful to see what fancy and prejudice can
do! Get once a hard opinion of a thing, and your
judgments will make light of all that is said for it,
and will see nothing that should reconcile you to it.
Partiality will carry you away from equity and truth.
Abundance of things appear now false and evil, to
men that once imagine them to be so, which would
seem harmless, if not laudable, if they were tried by
a mind that is clear from prejudice.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVI. Judge not of doctrines and worship
by persons, but rather of persons by their doctrine
and worship (together with their lives). The world
is all prone to be carried by respect to persons. I
confess where any thing is to be taken upon trust,
we must rather trust the intelligent, experienced,
honest, and credible, than the ignorant and incredible;
but where the word of God must be our rule, it
is perverse to judge of things by the persons that
hold them or oppose them: sometimes a bad man
may be in the right, and a good man in the wrong.
Try the way of the worst men before you reject it (in
disputable things). And try the opinions and way of
the best and wisest before you venture to receive them.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVII. Enslave not yourselves to any party
of men, so as to be over-desirous to please them, nor
over-fearful of their censure. Have a respect to all
the rest of the world as well as them. Most men
that once engage themselves in a party, do think
their honour and interest is involved with them, and
that they stand or fall with the favour of their party,
and therefore make them (before they are aware)
the masters of their consciences.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVIII. Regard more the judgment of
aged, ripe, experienced men, that have seen the
fruits of the various courses of professors of religion,
than of the young, unripe, unexperienced, hot-headed
sort. Zeal is of great use to execute the resolutions
of a well-informed man: and the zeal of others is
very useful to warm the hearts of such as do converse
with them. But when it comes to matter of
judgment once, to decide a case of difficulty, aged
experience hath far the advantage; and in no cases
more, than in those where peace and concord are
concerned, where rash, hot-headed youth is very
prone to precipitant courses, which must be afterwards
repented of.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIX. When fervent, self-conceited people
would carry down all by censoriousness and passion,
it is time for the pastors and the aged and riper sort
of christians openly to rebuke them, and appear
against them, and stand their ground, and not to
comply with the misguided sort to escape their censures.
Nothing hath more caused schisms in the
church (except the pride and ambition of the clergy)
than that the riper and more judicious sort of people,
together with the ministers themselves, have been
so loth to lie under the bitter censures of the unexperienced,
younger, hotter sort; and to avoid such
censures and keep in with them, they have followed
those whom they should have led, and have been
drawn quite beyond their own understandings. God
hath made wisdom to be the guide of the church,
and zeal to follow and diligently execute the commands
of wisdom. Let ignorant, well meaning
people censure you as bitterly as they please, yet
keep your ground, and be not so proud or weak as to
prefer their good esteem before their benefit, and before
the pleasing of God. Sin not against your knowledge
to escape the censure of the ignorant. If you
do, God will make those men your scourges whom
you so much overvalued: and they shall prove to
their spiritual fathers as cockered children (like Absalom)
do to their natural fathers, and perhaps be
the breaking of your hearts. But if the pastors and
the riper, experienced christians will stand their
ground, and stick together, and rebuke the exorbitancies
of the censorious younger ones, they will
maintain the credit of the gospel, and keep the truth,
and the church's peace, and the hotspurs will in time
either repent and be sober, or be shamed and disabled
to do much hurt.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XX. Take heed how you let loose your
zeal against the pastors of the church, lest you bring
their persons and next their office into contempt, and
so break the bonds of the church's unity and peace.
There is no more hope of maintaining the church's
unity and concord without the ministry, than of keeping
the strength or unity of the members without the
nerves. If these nerves be weak or labour of a convulsion
or other disease, it is curing and strengthening
them, and not the cutting them asunder, that
must prove to the welfare and safety of the body.
Meddle with the faults of the ministry only so far as
tendeth to a cure, of them or of the church, but not
to bring them into disgrace, and weaken their interest
in the people, and disable them from doing
good. Abhor that proud, rebellious spirit, that is
prone to set up itself against the officers of Christ,
and under pretence of greater wisdom or holiness,
to bring their guides into contempt; and is picking
quarrels with them behind their back, to make them
a scorn or odious to the hearers. Indeed a minister
of Satan that doth more harm in the church than
good, must be so detected as may best disable him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">{613}</a></span>
from doing harm. But he that doth more good than
hurt, must so be dissuaded from the hurt as not to be
disabled from the good. "My brethren, be not
many masters, (or teachers,) knowing that ye shall
receive the greater condemnation," James iii. 1.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXI. Look more with an eye of charity on
what is good in others and their worship of God,
than with an eye of malice to carp at what appeareth
evil. Some men have such distempered eyes, that
they can see almost nothing but faultiness in any
thing of another party which they look at; envy and
faction make them carp at every word and every
gesture: and they make no conscience of aggravating
every failing, and making idolatry of every mistake
in worship, and making heresy or blasphemy of every
mistake in judgment, and making apostasy of every
fall; nay, perhaps the truth itself shall have no better
a representation. As Dr. H. More well noteth,
It would do much more good in the world, if all
parties were forwarder to find out and commend what
is good in the doctrine and worship of all that differ
from them. This would win them to hearken to reforming
advice, and would keep up the credit of the
common truths and duties of religion in the world,
when this envious snarling at all that others do,
doth tend to bring the world to atheism, and banish
all reverence of religion, together with christian
charity, from the earth.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXII. Keep not strange to those from
whom you differ, but be acquainted with them, and
placidly hear what they have to say for themselves:
or else converse with them in christian love in all
those duties in which you are agreed, and this (if
you never talk of your differences) will do much to
reconcile you in all the rest.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_171" id="Ref_171" href="#Foot_171">[171]</a></span>
It is the common way
of division, uncharitableness, yea, and cruelty at
last, to receive hard reports of those that differ from
us behind their backs, and to believe and aggravate
all, and proceed to detraction and contention at a
distance, and in the dark, and never be familiarly
acquainted with them at all. There is something in
the apprehension of places, and persons, and things,
by the eye-sight, which no reports are able to match:
and so there is that satisfaction about men by familiar
acquaintance, which we cannot attain by
hearsay from any, how judicious soever. All factions
commonly converse together, and seek no familiar
converse with others, but believe them to be any
thing that is naught, and then report them to be so,
before they ever knew the persons of whom they
speak. I am persuaded this is one of the greatest
feeders of enmity, uncharitableness, contention, and
slanders in the world. I speak it upon great observation
and experience, I have seldom heard any
man bitterly oppose the servants of Christ, but
either grossly wicked, or those that never had much
acquaintance with them; and I see commonly, how
bitter soever men were before, when once they converse
together, and grow acquainted, they are more
reconciled. The reason is, partly because they find
less evil and more good in one another than before
they did believe to be in them; and partly because
uncharitableness and malice, being an ugly monster,
is bolder at a distance, but ashamed of itself before
your face: and therefore the pens of the champions
of malice are usually more bitter than their tongues
when they speak to you face to face. Of all the
furious adversaries that have raged against me in
the latter part of my life, I remember not one enemy
that I have, or ever had, that was ever familiar or
acquainted with me; and I have myself heard ill
reports of many, which by personal acquaintance I
have found to be all false. Keep together, and
either silence your differences, or gently debate
them; yea, rather chide it out, then withdraw asunder.
Familiarity feedeth love and unity.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXIII. Whenever you look at any corruption
in the church, look also at the contrary extreme,
and see and avoid the danger of one as well
as of the other. Be sure every error and church
corruption hath its extreme, and if you do not see
it, and the danger of it, you are the liker to run into
it. Look well on both sides if you would be safe.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXIV. Worship God yourselves in the
purest manner, and under the most edifying ministry
that lawfully you can attain; but be not too forward
to condemn others that reach not to your measure,
or attain not so much happiness; and deny not personal
communion sometimes, with churches that are
more blemished, and less fit for communion. And
when you cannot join locally with them, let them
have the communion of your hearts, in faith and
charity, and prayer for each other. I fear not here
openly to tell the world, that if I were turned loose
to my own liberty, I would ordinarily worship God
in that manner that I thought most pure and agreeable
to his will and word; but I would sometimes go
to the churches of other christians, that were fit for
christian communion, if there were such about me;
sometimes to the independents, sometimes to the
moderate anabaptists, sometimes to such as had a
liturgy as faulty as that of the Greek or the Ethiopian
churches; to show by my practice, what communion
my heart hath with them all.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXV. Take heed that you interest not religion
or the church in civil differences.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_172" id="Ref_172" href="#Foot_172">[172]</a></span>
This error
hath divided and ruined many famous churches, and
most injuriously made the holy truth and worship
of God to be a reproach and infamy among selfish,
partial, carnal men. When princes and states fall
out among themselves, they will needs draw the
ministers to their sides, and then one side will certainly
condemn them, and call them all that self-interest
and malice can invent; and commonly when
the controversy is only in point of law or politics, it
is religion that bears the blame of all: and the differences
of lawyers and statesmen must be charged
upon divines, that the devil may be able to make
them useless, as to the good of all that party that is
against them, and may make religion itself be called
rebellion. And oh that God would maintain the
peace of kingdoms; and kings and subjects were all
lovers of peace, the rather because the differences
in states do cause so commonly divisions in the
church. It would make a man wonder (and a lover
of history to lament) to observe in the differences
between the pope and Henry the fourth, and other
emperors, how the historians are divided, one half
commending him that the other half condemneth;
and how the bishops and churches were one half for
the pope, and the other for the emperor; and one
half still accounted rebels or schismatics by the
other, though they were all of one religion. It is
more to ruin the church, than kingdoms, that Satan
laboureth so much to kindle wars, and breed civil
differences in the world; and therefore let him that
loveth the church's peace, be an obedient subject,
and an enemy of sedition, and a lover and defender
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">{614}</a></span>
of the civil peace and government in the place that
God hath set him in: for this is pleasing unto God.</p>

<p>I know there are some, that with too bloody and
calamitous success, have in most ages given other
kind of directions for the extirpation of error, heresy,
and schism, than I have here given:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_173" id="Ref_173" href="#Foot_173">[173]</a></span>
but God hath
still caused the most wise, and holy, and charitable,
and experienced christians to bear their testimony
against them. And he hath ever caused their way
of cruelty to turn to their own shame: and though
(like treasons and robberies) it seem for the time
present to serve their turn, it is bitterness in the
end, and leaveth a stinking memorial of their names
and actions to posterity. And the treatises of reconcilers,
(such as our Halls, Ushers, Bergius, Burroughs,
and many other,) by the delectable savour
of unity and charity, are sweet and acceptable to
prudent and peaceable persons, though usually unsuccessful
with the violent that needed them.</p>

<p>Besides the forecited witness of Sir Francis Bacon,
&amp;c. I will here add one of the most ancient, and one
or two of this age, whom the contrary-minded do
mention with the greatest honour. Justin Martyr,
Dial. cum Tryph. doth at large give his judgment,
that a judaizing christian, who thinketh it best to be
circumcised and keep the law of Moses, be suffered
in his opinion and practice, and admitted to the
communion and privileges of the church, and loved
as one that may be saved in that way, so be it he do
not make it his business to persuade others to his
way, and teach it as necessary to salvation or communion;
for such he doth condemn.</p>

<p>King James by the pen of Is. Casaubon telleth
Cardinal du Perron, that "His Majesty thinketh, that
for concord there is no nearer way, than diligently
to separate things necessary from the unnecessary,
and to bestow all our labour that we may agree in
the things necessary, and that in things unnecessary
there may be place given for christian liberty. The
king calleth these things simply necessary, which
either the word of God expressly commandeth to be
believed or done, or which the ancient church did
gather from the word of God by necessary consequence.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Grotius Annot. in Matt. xiii. 41, is so full and
large upon it, that I must entreat the reader to peruse
his own words; where by arguments and authority
he vehemently rebuketh the spirit of fury, cruelty,
and uncharitableness, which under pretence of government,
discipline, and zeal, denieth that liberty
and forbearance, even to heretics and offenders,
(much more when to the faithful ministers of Christ,)
which human frailty hath made necessary, and Christ
hath commanded his servants to grant. Concluding,
<i>Ubi solitudinem fecerant, pacem appellabant</i> (as Tertul.).
<i>Et his omnibus obtendi solet studium divini nominis;
sed plerumque obtendi tantum. Nam Deus dedignatur
coacta servitia; nec placere illi potest quod vi humana
exprimitur. Reipsa solent qui id faciunt non nomini
divino, sed suis honoribus, suis commodis et tranquillitati
consulere; quod scit ille qui mentes introspicit. Atque
ita fit, ut lolium evellatur cum tritico, innocentes cum
nocentibus: immo ut triticum sæpe sumatur pro lolio:
non enim tam bene agitur cum rebus humanis, ut semper
meliora pluribus aut validioribus placeant: sed ut in
grege taurus, ita inter homines, qui viribus est editior,
imbecilliorem cædit: et iidem sæpe quæ pati se quærebantur,
mox in alios audent.&mdash;Lege cætera.</i></p>

<p>Again, I entreat those that would escape the sin
of schism, to read seriously the foresaid Treatises of
peacemakers; especially Bishop Hall's "Peacemaker;"
Bishop Usher's "Sermon on Ephes. iv. 3;"
and Mr. Jeremy Burroughs' "Irenicum:" to
which I may add Mr. Stillingfleet's "Irenicum," for
the hot contenders about church government;
though I believe all the substance of church order
to be of divine institution: and Jac. Acontii "Stratag.
Satanæ."</p>

<p>And it must be carefully noted, that one way by
which Satan tempteth men into church divisions, is
by an over-vehement zeal against dividers; and so
he would draw the rulers of the world, under pretence
of a zeal for unity and peace, to raise persecutions
against all that are guilty of any excess of
scrupulosity about church communion, or of any
principles or practices which a little swerve from
true catholicism: and so by the cruelty of their
penalties, silencing ministers, and vexing the people,
they much increase the divisions which they would
heal: for when Satan cannot do his work barefaced
and directly, he useth to be the forwardest in
seeming to do good, and to take part with Christ,
and truth, and godliness; and then his way is to
over-do: he will be over-orthodox, and over-godly,
and over-peaceable, that he hug the church and
truth to death, by his too hard embracements. As
in families and neighbourhoods, some cross words
must be passed over if we would have peace; and
he that for every provoking, unpeaceable word of
another, will raise a storm, shall be himself the most
unpeaceable: so is it in the church; he that cannot
bear with the weaknesses of the younger sort of
christians, who are too much inclined by their zeal
against sin, to dividing ways, but will presently let
fly at them as schismatics, and make them odious,
and excommunicate or punish them according to his
wrath, shall increase the zeal and the number of
dividers, and prove himself the greatest divider.</p>

<p>And by this violence and destroying zeal of orthodox
rulers, against the real faults and infirmities
of some separating, well meaning men, a far greater
number of heterodox rulers are encouraged to persecute
the most learned, sober, and peaceable ministers,
and the most godly and faithful of their subjects,
who dare not conform to all their unrighteous
edicts, and ecclesiastical laws, in things forbidden
by the law of Christ: and all this is done upon
pretence of promoting unity and peace, and suppressing
heresy and schism. And so persecution
becometh the devil's engine to keep out the gospel
and godliness from the infidel world, and to keep
them under in the christian world.</p>

<p><i>Sed tamen sive illud (Origenis de Redemptione futura
diabolorum) error est, ut ego sentio; sive hæresis
ut putatur, non solum reprimi non potuit multis animadversionibus
sacerdotum, sed nequaquam tam late se
potuisset effundere, nisi contentione crevisset</i>: inquit
Posthumianus in Sulp. Severi Dialog. i.</p>

<p><i>Sed non fuit animus ibi consistere, ubi recens fraternæ
cladis fervebat invidia. Nam etsi fortasse
videantur parere episcopis debuisse, non ob hanc tamen
causam multitudinem tantam sub Christi confessione
viventem, præsertim ab episcopis oportuisset affligi.</i>
Id. ibid. speaking of the bishops provoking the
secular power to afflict the monks of Alexandria for
defending Origen.</p>

<p>When the emperor Constantius would by violence
force the orthodox to hold communion with the
Arians, he did but make the breach the wider. Read
Lucifer Calaritanus <i>de non conveniendo cum hæreticis</i>
(in Biblioth. Patr. tom. ix. p. 1045, &amp;c.). The emperor
saith, that the orthodox were enemies to peace,
and unity, and brotherly love, and that he was resolved
to have unity and peace in his dominions:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">{615}</a></span>
therefore he imprisoned the orthodox and banished
them. <i>Propterea odis nos, quia concilium vestrum malignantium
execremur; propterea in exilio sumus;
propterea in carcere necamur; propterea nobis solis
prohibetur conspectus; idcirco reclusi in tenebras custodimur
ingenti custodia: hujus rei causa nullus ad nos
visendos admittitur hominum; quia videlicet noluerimus
vobiscum impiis sacrilegis ullam scelerum vestrorum
habere societatem.</i> Ibid. p. 1050. Which stirred up this
bishop in particular to go too far from free communion
even with the penitent Arians, and heap up
more scriptures against that communion which the
emperor commanded, than any had done before.
<i>Nobis dicebas, Pacem volo fieri; et in corde tuo manens
adversarius religionis nostræ, cogitabat per te facere
nos idololatras, &amp;c.</i> p. 1051. <i>Consilia vestra contra
suam prolata ecclesiam reprobat Deus: nec enim potest
odire populum suum, hæreditatem suam, et amare vos
filios pestilentiæ, vos persecutores servorum suorum:
dixisti, Facite pacem cum episcopis sectæ meæ Arrianis,
et estote in unum; et dicit Dei Spiritus, vias impiorum
noli exequi, neque æmuleris viam iniquorum. &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;Dulce
quibusdam videtur, quo tibi regi in amicitias
jungantur suscipiendo hæresin tuam: sed amarius felle
sensuri cum tecum in perpetuum cœperint in perpetua
gehenna sentire, qui tecum esse deligerunt, tunc dicturi,
Væ nobis, qui Constantium Imperatorem Deo præposuerimus.</i>
Abundance more he writeth to prove
that the emperor being a heretic, they must have no
communion with him or his bishops. And when
the emperor complained hereupon, that they wronged
and dishonoured him whom they should honour, the
said Lucifer wrote his next book, <i>de non parcendo in
Deum delinquentibus</i>; which beginneth, <i>Superatum
te, Imperator, a Dei servis ex omni cum conspexisses
parte, dixisti passum te ac pati a nobis contra monita
sacrarum Scripturarum contumeliam: dicis nos insolentes
extitisse, circa te quem honorari decuerit. Si
quisquam Dei cultorum pepercit apostatis, sint vera quæ
dicis de nobis</i>; and so he heapeth up as many texts
for rough dealing with offending kings; I give this
one instance to show the fruits of violence, as pretended
for peace and unity.</p>

<p>Of the persecutions of the faithful in most ages,
even by professed christians themselves, and God's
disowning that spirit of cruelty by his special providences,
all church history maketh mention: and
how the names of such persecuting hypocrites have
stunk in the nostrils of all sober men when their
tragedy was fully acted and understood. Especially
the poor churches called Waldenses, Picards, and
Albigenses, have felt the grievousest effects of this
tyranny, and yet have the testimony of the best and
wisest men, to have been the purest and the nearest
to the apostolic simplicity in all the world; and the
memory of their enemies and persecutors is an abhorrence
to the sons of charity and peace. Read
Lasitius and Commenius of their discipline, and
Bishop Usher de Eccles. succes. et statu. I will recite
one notable passage mentioned by Thuanus and
Commenius, the one Hist. lib. xxxvi. the other de
bono Unit. et Ord. Discipl. p. 59. Maximilian, that
good and moderate emperor, being one day in the
coach with Joh. Crato only, (his chief physician and
a learned protestant), lamenting the divisions of christians,
asked Crato, which sort he thought came
nearest to the apostolic simplicity: he answered, He
thought that honour belonged to the brethren called
Picards. The emperor said, He thought so too:
which Crato acquainting them with, encouraged
them to dedicate to him a book of part of their devotions;
for the year before God had thus marvellously
saved him from having a hand in their blood.
Joachimus a Nova Domo, chancellor of Bohemia,
went to Vienna, and gave the emperor no rest, till
he had procured him to subscribe a mandate for
the reviving of a former persecuting mandate against
them: having got his commission, and passing just
out of the gates of Vienna, as he was upon the bridge
over the Danubius, the bridge brake under him, and
he and all his retinue fell into that great and terrible
water; and all were drowned except six horsemen,
and one young nobleman, who, seeing his lord in
the waves, catched hold of his gold chain, and held
him till some fishermen came in boats, but found
him dead, and his box with the commission sunk
past recovery. This nobleman who survived, was
sensible of God's judgment, and turned to the brethren
in religion, and the mandate was no further
prosecuted. (Such another story Bishop Usher was
wont to tell how Ireland was saved from persecution
in Queen Mary's days.)</p>

<p>But it is the most heinous cruelty, when, as in
Daniel's case, there are laws of impiety or iniquity,
made of purpose to entrap the innocent, by them
that confess, We shall find no fault against this
Daniel, except it be concerning the law of his God:
and then men must be taken in these spiders' webs,
and accused as schismatical, or what the contrivers
please. And especially when it is real holiness
which is hated, and order, unity, concord, peace, or
obedience to our pastors, is made the pretence, for
the malicious oppression of it. Gildas and Salvian
have told church governors of this at large: and
many of the persecuted protestants have more largely
told the Roman clergy of it.</p>

<p>It is a smart complaint of him that wrote the Epist.
de malus Doctoribus, ascribed to Pope Sixtus III.
<i>Hujus doctrinæ causa (pro sanctitate scilicet) paucos
amicos conquirunt, et plures inimicos, necesse est enim
eos qui peccatorum vitia condemnant, tantos habere contrarios,
quantos exercere vitia delectat: inde est etiam
quod iniquis et impiis factionibus opprimuntur: quod
criminibus falsis appetuntur, quod hæresis etiam perfunduntur
infamia: quod hic omnis inimicorum suorum
sermo ab ipsorum sumit obtrectatione materiam. Sed
quid mirum ut flagitiosis hæresis videatur doctrina justitiæ?
Quibus tamen hæresis? Ipsorum secretum
patet tantum inimicis, cum si fides dictis inesset, amici
illud potius scire potuissent, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The cause is, saith Prosper de vit. Contempl. lib. i.
cap. 20. et ex eo Hilitgarius Camarac. lib. v. cap. 19.
<i>Sed nos præsentibus delectati, dum in hac vita commoda
nostra et honores inquirimus, non ut meliores sed ut
ditiores, non ut sanctiores, sed ut honoratiores simus,
cæteris festinamus. Nec gregem Domini qui nobis pascendus,
tuendusque commissus est, sed nostras voluntates,
dominationem, divitias, et cætera blandimenta carnaliter
cogitamus. Pastores dici volumus, nec tamen
esse contendimus. Officii non vitamus laborem, appetimus
dignitatem; immundorum spirituum feras a grege
dilacerando non pellimus; et quod eis remanserat, ipsi
consumimus: quando peccantes divites vel potentes non
solum non arguimus, sed etiam veneramur; ne nobis aut
munera solita offensi non dirigant, aut obsequia desiderata
subducant: ac sic muneribus eorum et obsequiis
capti, immo per hæc illis addicti, loqui eis de peccato
suo aut de futuro judicio formidamus; ad hoc tantum
potentes effecti, ut nobis in subjectos dominationem tyrannicam
vindicemus; non ut afflictos contra violentiam
potentum qui in eos ferarum more sæviunt, defendamus.
Inde est quod tam a potentibus hujus mundi,
quam a nobis, quod pejus est, nonnulli graviter fatigati
deperiunt, quos se de manu nostra Dominus requisiturum
terribiliter comminatur</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sulp. Severus also toucheth the sore when he
saith, Hist. lib. ii. <i>Certatim gloriosa in certamina ruebatur,
multoque avidius tum martyria gloriosis mortibus</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">{616}</a></span>
<i>quærebantur, quam nunc episcopatus pravis ambitionibus
appetuntur.</i></p>

<p>But when he saith, ibid. after Constantine's delivery
of the church, <i>Neque ulterius persecutionem
fore credimus, nisi eam quam sub fine jam sæculi antichristus
exercebit</i>, either he was grossly mistaken,
or else those are the instruments of antichrist that
are not thought so.</p>

<p>It is a most notable instance to our purpose which
Severus ends his history with, of the mischievous
zeal of orthodox Ithacius and Idacius against Priscillian
and his gnostics; and worthy of the study of
the prelates of the church: <i>Idacius sine modo et
ultra quam oportuit Istantium sociosque ejus lacessens,
facem nascenti incendio subdidit: ut exasperaverit malos
potius quam compresserit</i>. In sum, they got the magistrate
to interpose and banish the gnostics, who
quickly learned, by bribing court officers, to turn
the emperor against the orthodox for themselves;
till the zeal of Idacius and Ithacius grew so hot as
to accuse even the best men, yea, St. Martin himself,
of favouring the gnostics: and at last got another
tyrannical emperor to put Priscillian and many other
gnostics to death, though they withdrew from the
accusation, as tending to their own confusion. And
Severus saith, <i>Certe Ithacium nihil pensi, nihil sancti
habuisse definio: fuit enim audax, loquax, impudens,
sumptuosus, veneri et gulæ plurimum impertiens. Hic
stultitiæ eo usque processerat, ut omnes etiam sanctos
viros, quibus aut studium inerat iectionis, aut propositum
erat certare jejuniis, tanquam Priscilliani socios et
discipulos, in crimen arcesseret. Ausus etiam miser est,
Martino episcopo, viro plane apostolis conferendo, palam
objectare hæresis infamiam:&mdash;&mdash;quia non desinebat
increpare Ithacium, ut ab accusatione desisteret.</i> And
when the leaders were put to death, the heresy increased
more, and honoured Priscillian as a martyr,
and reproached the orthodox as wicked persecutors:
and the end was, that the church was filled by it
with divisions and manifold mischiefs, and all the
most godly made the common scorn. <i>Inter hæc
plebs Dei et optimus quisque, probro atque ludibrio habebatur.</i>
They are the last words of Severus's History;
and changing the names are calculated for
another meridian, and for later years.</p>

The true placing the bonds of unity importeth exceedingly.
Which will be done if the points fundamental, and of
substance in religion, were truly discerned and distinguished
from points not merely of faith, but of opinion, order, or good
intention. This is a thing that may seem to many a matter
trivial, and done already; but if it were done less partially
it would be embraced more generally. L. Bacon, Essay iii.</p>

Peace containeth infinite blessings: it strengtheneth
faith: it kindleth charity. The outward peace of the church
distilleth into peace of conscience: and it turneth the writing
and reading of controversies into treatises of mortification
and devotion. Against procuring unity by sanguinary
persecutions, see Lord Bacon, Essay iii. Surely there
is no better way to stop the rising of new sects and schisms,
than to reform abuses, to compound the smaller differences,
to proceed mildly, and not with sanguinary persecutions, and
rather to take off the principal authors by winning and advancing
them, than to enrage them by violence and bitterness.

There is scarce any church in christendom at this day that
doth not obtrude, not only falsehood, but such falsehoods that
will appear to any free spirit pure contradictions and impossibilities;
and that with the same gravity, authority, and importunity,
that they do the holy oracles of God. Now the
consequents of this must needs be sad; For what knowing
and conscientious man, but will be driven off, if he cannot
assert the truth, without open asserting of a gross lie? Id. p.
526. And as for opinions, though some may be better than
other some, yet none should exclude from the fullest enjoyments
of either private or public rights; supposing there be
no venom of the persecutive spirit mingled with them; but
every one that professeth the faith of Christ, and believeth
the Scriptures in the historical sense, &amp;c. See Hales of

Acosta, l. vi. c. 23. p. 579. Nothing so much hurteth this
church as a rabble of hirelings and self-seekers: for what
can natural men, that scarce have the Spirit, do in the cause
of God? A few in number that are excellent in virtue, will
more promote the work of God.&mdash;But they that come hither
being humble, and lovers of souls, taking Christ for their
pattern, and bearing in their bodies his cross and death, shall
most certainly find heavenly treasures, and inestimable delights.
But when will this be? When men cease to be men,
and to savour the things of men; and to seek and gape after
the things of men. With men this is utterly impossible; but
with God all things are possible: Because this is hard in the
eyes of this people, shall it therefore be hard in my eyes, saith
the Lord? Zech. viii. 6. pag. 580. I may say to some ministers
that cry out of the schismatical disobedience of the people, as
Acosta doth to those that cried out of the Indians' dulness
and wickedness. It is long of the teachers. Deal with them
in all possible love and tenderness, away with covetousness,
lordliness, and cruelty; give them the example of an upright
life, open to them the way of truth, and teach them according
to their capacity, and diligently hold on in this way, whoever
thou art that art a minister of the gospel, and (saith he)
as ever I hope to enjoy thee, O Lord Jesu Christ, I am persuaded
the harvest will he plentiful and joyful. Lib. iv. p.
433, et passim. But (saith he) we quickly cease our labours,
and must presently have hasty and plenteous fruit. But the
kingdom of God is not such: verily, it is not such, but, as
Christ hath told us, like seed cast into the earth, which groweth
up by degrees we know not how, p. 433, 434. Jerom's
case is many another's: Concivit odia perditorum: oderunt
eum hæretici, quia eos impugnare non desinit: oderunt clerici,
quia vitam eorum insectatur et crimina. Sed plane eum
boni omnes admirantur et diligunt. Posthumianus in Sulp.

et conversatione populorum, inter clericos dissidentes, inter
episcopos sævientes, cum fere quotidianis scandalis hinc
atque inde premeretur, inexpugnabili tamen adversus omnia
virtute fundatus stetit.&mdash;Nec tamen huic crimini miscebo
populares, soli illum clerici, soli nesciunt sacerdotes, nec
immerito: nosse illum invidi noluerunt: quia si virtutes
illius nossent, suorum vitia cognovissent.</p>

Yet I excuse not impiety or insufficiency in ministers.
It was one of Solon's laws, Qui nequitia ac flagitiis insignis
est, tribunali, publicisque suggestis arcendus est. And Gildas
saith to the ungodly pastors of Britain, Apparet ergo eum
qui vos sacerdotes sciens ex corde dicit, non esse eximium
christianum.&mdash;Quomodo vos aliquid solvetis, ut sit solutum in
cœlis, a cœlo ob scelera adempti? et immanium peccatorum
funibus compediti? Qua ratione aliquid in terra ligabitis,
quod supra mundum etiam ligetur, propter vosmet ipsos qui
ita ligati iniquitatibus in hoc mundo tenemini, ut in cœlos
nunquam ascendatis, sed in infausta tartari ergastula, non
conversi in hac vita ad dominum, decidatis, Fol. ult. O inimici
Dei, et non sacerdotes! O licitatores malorum, et non

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

<span class="small">HOW TO BEHAVE OURSELVES IN THE PUBLIC ASSEMBLIES, AND THE WORSHIP
THERE PERFORMED, AND AFTER THEM.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">I have</span>
purposely given such particular directions in
part ii. on this subject, and written so many books
about it,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_174" id="Ref_174" href="#Foot_174">[174]</a></span>
and said so much also in the Cases of Conscience,
that I shall here only cast in a few common
directions, lest the reader think I make a balk.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Let your preparations in secret and in
your family on the beginning of the Lord's days, be
such as conduce to fit you for the public worship.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_175" id="Ref_175" href="#Foot_175">[175]</a></span>
Run not to church as ungodly people do, with a carnal
heart, that never sought God before you went,
nor considered what you go about; as if all your religion
were to make up the number of the auditors;
and you thought God must not be worshipped and
obeyed at home, but only in the church. God may
in mercy meet with an unprepared heart, and open
his eyes and heart, and save him; but he hath made
no promise of it to any such. He that goeth to worship
that God at church, whom he forgetteth and
despiseth in his heart and house, may expect to be
despised by him. O consider what it is for a sinner
that must shortly die, to go with the servants of God
to worship him; to pray for his salvation, and to
hear what God hath to say to him by his minister,
for the life of his immortal soul!</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Enter not into the holy assembly either
superstitiously or unreverently. Not as if the bending
of the knee, and mumbling over a few words
with a careless, ignorant mind, and spending an hour
there as carelessly, would save your souls: nor yet
as if the relation which the worship, the worshippers,
and the dedicated place have unto God, deserved
not a special honour and regard. Though God
be ever with us, every where; yet every time, and
place, and person, and business is not equally related
to God. And holiness is no unfit attribution, for that
company or that place, which is related to God,
though but by the lawful separation and dedication
of man. To be uncovered in those countries where
uncovering signifieth reverence, is very well becoming
a reverent soul; except when the danger of
cold forbids it. It is an unhappy effect of our contentions,
that many that seem most reverent and
holy, in their high regard of holy things, do yet
carry themselves with more unreverent deportment,
than those that themselves account profane. God
is the God of soul and body, and must be worshipped
by both; and while they are united, the actions
of one are helpful to the other, as well as due and
decent.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. If you can, come at the beginning,
that you may show your attendance upon God, and
your esteem of all his worship. Especially in our
assemblies, where so great a part of the duty, (as
confession, praises, reading the Scriptures,) are all
at the beginning. And it is meet that you thereby
show that you prefer public worship before private,
and that needless businesses keep you not away.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. If you are free, and can do it lawfully,
choose the most able, holy teacher that you can
have, and be not indifferent whom you hear. For
oh how great is the difference; and how bad are
our hearts; and how great our necessity of the clearest
doctrine, and the liveliest helps! Nor be you
indifferent what manner of people you join with,
nor what manner of worship is there performed;
but in all choose the best when you are free. But
where you are not free, or can have no better, refuse
not to make use of weaker teachers, or to communicate
with faulty congregations in a defective, faulty
manner of worship, sobeit you are not compelled to
sin. And think not that all the faults of the prayers,
or communicants, are imputed to all that join with
them in that worship. For then we should join with
none in all the world.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. When the minister is weak, be the
more watchful against prejudice and sluggishness
of heart, lest you lose all. Mark that word of God
which he readeth to you, and reverence, and love,
and lay up that. It was the law, read and meditated
on, which David saith the godly do delight in.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_176" id="Ref_176" href="#Foot_176">[176]</a></span>
The sacred Scriptures are not so obscure and useless
as the papists do pretend, but convert the soul, and
are able to make us wise unto salvation. Christ
went ordinarily to the synagogues, where even bad
men did read Moses and the prophets every sabbath
day. There are thousands that cannot read themselves,
who must come to the assembly to hear that
word read, which they cannot read or hear at home.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">{617}</a></span>
Every sentence of Scripture hath a divine excellency,
and therefore had we nothing but the reading of it,
and that by a bad man, a holy soul may profit by it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Mind not so much the case of others
present as yourselves; and think not so much how
bad such and such a one is, and unworthy to be
there, as how bad you are yourselves, and unworthy
of communion with the people of the Lord, and what
a mercy it is that you have admittance, and are not
cast out from those holy opportunities.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. Take heed of a peevish, quarrelsome
humour, that disposeth you to carp at all that is said
and done, and to find fault with every mode and circumstance,
and to affect a causeless singularity, as
thinking that your own ways, and words, and orders,
are far more excellent than other men's: think ill of
nothing out of a quarrelsome disposition, but only
as evidence constraineth you to dissent. And then
remember that we are all imperfect, and faulty men
must needs perform a faulty worship, if any, for it
cannot be better than the agent.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. When you meet with a word in a
sermon or prayer, which you do not like, let it not
stop you, and hinder your fervent and peaceable proceeding
in the rest; as if you must not join in that
which is good, if there be any faulty mixture in it.
But go on in that which you approve, and thank
God that pardoneth the infirmities of others as well
as your own.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Conform yourselves to all the lawful
gestures and customs of the church with which you
join. You come not hither proudly to show the congregation,
that you are wiser in the circumstances
of worship than they, nor needlessly to differ from
them, much less to harden men into a scorn of strictness,
by seeing you place religion in singularities
in lawful and indifferent things. But you come to
exercise love, peace, and concord, and with one mind
and mouth to glorify God. Stand when the church
standeth; sit when the church sitteth; kneel when
the church kneeleth, in cases where God doth not
forbid it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. Take heed of a customary, formal,
senseless heart, that tolerateth itself from day to day,
to do holy things in a common manner, and with a
common, dull, and careless mind: for that is to profane
them. Call in your thoughts when they attempt
to wander; stir up your hearts when you feel them
dull. Remember what you are about, and with
whom it is that you have to do, and that you tread
on the dust of them who had such opportunities before
you which are now all gone, and so will yours.
You hear and pray for more than your lives; therefore
do it not as in jest or as asleep.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. Do all in faith and hope. Believe
what you may get of God in prayer, and by an obedient
hearing of his word. Would you not go cheerfully
to the king, if he had promised you to grant
whatever you ask? Hath not God promised you
more than kings can give you? Oh it is an unbelieving
and a despairing heart, that turneth all into
dead formality! Did you but hope that God would
do all that for you which he hath told you he will
do, and that you might get more by prayer than by
your trades, or projects, or all your friends, you
would go to God with more earnestness and more
delight.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. Apply all the word of God to yourselves
according to its usefulness. Ask as you go,
How doth this concern me? this reproof, this mark,
this counsel, this comfort, this exhortation, this direction?
Remember as much as you can, but especially
the most practical, useful parts. Get it home
so deep upon your hearts, that it may not easily slide
away. Root it by close application as you go, that
affection may constrain you to remember it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. Above all, resolve to obey what
God shall make known to be his will; take heed
lest any wilful sin should escape the power of the
word; and should ordinarily go away with you as it
came. Careless hearing and careless living tend
most dangerously to a hardened heart and a forsaken
state. If you regard iniquity in your heart,
God will not hear your prayers. The sacrifice of
the wicked is abominable to him. The foolish shall
not stand in his sight, he hateth all the workers of
iniquity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_177" id="Ref_177" href="#Foot_177">[177]</a></span>
He that turneth away his ear from hearing
(that is, obeying) the law, even his prayer is
abominable. To the wicked saith God, What hast
thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth, seeing
thou hatest instruction, and hast cast my words
behind thee? Obedience is better than sacrifice.
He that nameth the name of Christ must depart from
iniquity, or else God will not find his mark upon
him, nor take him to be one of his. Christ's sheep
know his voice and follow him, and to them he will
give eternal life. But if you had preached or done
miracles in his name, he will say to you, "Depart
from me, I know you not," if ye be workers of iniquity.
Look therefore to your foot (to your heart
and life) when you go to the house of God, and be
more ready to hear (his law that must govern you,
that you may know his will and do it) than to offer
the sacrifice of fools, (that is, disobedient sinners,)
that think by sacrifices and outside worship to get
pardon for an unholy life, and to reconcile God to
them in their sins, not knowing that thus they add
sin to sin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_178" id="Ref_178" href="#Foot_178">[178]</a></span>
If you seek God daily, and delight to
know his ways, as a nation that did righteousness
and forsook not the ordinance of their God; if you
ask of him the ordinances of justice, (sound doctrine,
regular worship, strict discipline,) and take delight
in approaching to God; if you humble your souls
with frequent fasts; and yet live in a course of wilful
disobedience, you labour in vain, and aggravate
your sins, and preachers had need to lift up their
voices and be louder trumpets to tell you of your
sins, than to other men.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_179" id="Ref_179" href="#Foot_179">[179]</a></span>
But if ye will wash you,
and make you clean, and put away the evil of your
doings, cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment,
relieve the oppressed, &amp;c.; you may then
come with boldness and confidence unto God. Otherwise
to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices?
your oblations will be vain, and your incense
abominable. If ye be willing and obedient, you
shall be blessed; but if ye refuse and rebel you shall
be destroyed, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken
it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_180" id="Ref_180" href="#Foot_180">[180]</a></span>
If you do well shall you not be accepted? but
if ye do evil, sin lieth at the door. Let your profession
be never so great, and your parts and expressions
never so seraphical, sin is a reproach to
any people; and if you would hide yourselves from
justice in the purest church, among the holiest people,
and the most numerous and longest prayers, be
sure that your sin will find you out.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_181" id="Ref_181" href="#Foot_181">[181]</a></span>
Your secret lust,
your covetous over-reaching, your secret gluttony or
tippling, much more your crimson sins, will surely
find you out.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_182" id="Ref_182" href="#Foot_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">{618}</a></span>
Alas! what then will those miscreants do, whose
sins are scarlet, bloody persecutions, under pretence
of promoting unity, and obedience, and the catholic
church, while the cloak or cover of it is but the
thin, transparent spider-web of human traditions,
and numerous ceremonies, and childish complimenting
with God; and when they have nothing but the
prayers of a long liturgy, to cover the effects of their
earthly, sensual, and diabolical zeal and wisdom, (as
St. James calls it, chap. iii. 15, 16,) and to concoct
the widows' houses which they devour, and to put a
reverence upon the office and work, which they labour
all the week to render reproachful, by a sensual,
luxurious, idle life, and by perfidious making merchandise
of souls.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_183" id="Ref_183" href="#Foot_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>As ever you care what becometh of your souls,
take heed lest sin grow bold under prayers, and
grow familiar and contemptuous of sermons and
holy speeches, and lest you keep a custom of religious
exercises and wilful sins. For oh, how doth
this harden now, and wound hereafter! He is the
best hearer, that is the holiest liver, and faithfullest
obeyer.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Be not a bare hearer of the prayers
of the pastor, whether it be by liturgy or without.
For that is but hypocrisy, and a sin of omission;
you come not thither only to hear prayers, but to
pray; and kneeling is not praying; but it is a profession
that you pray. And will you be prayerless
even in the house of prayer, and when you profess
and seem to pray, and so add hypocrisy to impiety?
I fear many that seem religious, and would have
those kept from the sacrament that pray not in their
families, do very ordinarily tolerate themselves in
this gross omission, and mocking of God, and are
prayerless themselves even when they seem to pray.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XV. Stir up your hearts in an especial
manner to the greatest alacrity and joy, in speaking
and singing the praises of God. The Lord's day is
a day of joy and thanksgiving, and the praises of
God are the highest and holiest employment upon
earth. And if ever you should do any thing with all
your might, and with a joyful and triumphing frame
of soul, it is this. Be glad that you may join with
the sacred assemblies, in heart and voice, in so heavenly
a work. And do not as some humoursome,
peevish persons (that know not the danger of that
proud disease) fall to quarrelling with David's
Psalms, as unsuitable to some of the hearers, or to
nauseate every failing in the metre, so as to turn so
holy a duty into neglect or scorn; (for alas! such
there are near me where I dwell;) nor let prejudice
against melody, or church music (if you dwell where
it is used) possess you with a splenetic disgust of
that which should be your most joyful work. And
if you know how much the incorporate soul must
make use of the body in harmony, and in the joyful
praises of Jehovah, do not then quarrel with lawful
helps, because they are sensible and corporeal.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVI. Be very considerate and serious in
sacramental renewings of your covenant with God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_184" id="Ref_184" href="#Foot_184">[184]</a></span>
O think what great things you come thither to receive!
And think what a holy work you have to
do! And think what a life it is that you must promise!
So solemn a covenanting with God, and of
so great importance, requireth a most holy, reverent,
and serious frame of soul. But yet let not the unwarrantable
differencing this ordinance from God's
praises and the rest, seduce you into the common
errors of the times: I mean, 1. Of those that hence
are brought to think that the sacrament should never
be received without a preparatory day of humiliation,
above the preparation for an ordinary Lord's
day's work. 2. And therefore receive it seldom;
whereas the primitive churches never spent a Lord's
day together without it. 3. Those that turn it into
a perplexing, terrifying thing, for fear of being unprepared,
when it should be their greatest comfort,
and when they are not so perplexed about their unpreparedness
to any other duty. 4. Those that make
so great a difference betwixt this and church prayers,
praises, and other church worship, as that they
take this sacrament only for the proper work and
privilege of church members; and thereupon turn it
into an occasion of our great contentions and divisions,
while they fly from sacramental communion
with others, more than from communion in the other
church worship. Oh what hath our subtle enemy
done against the love, peace, and unity of christians,
especially in England, under pretence of sacramental
purity!</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVII. Perform all your worship to God,
as in heart-communion with all Christ's churches
upon earth; even those that are faulty, though not
with their faults. Though you can be present but
with one, yet consent as present in spirit with all,
and separate not in heart from any one, any further
than they separate from Christ.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVIII. Accordingly let the interest of the
church of Christ be very much upon your heart, and
pray as hard for it as for yourself.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIX. Yea, remember in all, what relation
you have to the heavenly society and choir, and
think how they worship God in heaven, that you
may strive to imitate them in your degree. Of which
more anon.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XX. Let your whole course of life after,
savour of a church frame; live as the servants of
that God whom you worship, and as ever before
him. Live in the love of those christians with whom
you have communion, and do not quarrel with them
at home; nor despise, nor persecute them with
whom you join in the worshipping of God. And do
not needlessly open the weaknesses of the minister
to prejudice others against him and the worship.
And be not religious at the church alone, for then
you are not truly religious at all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMUNION WITH HOLY SOULS DEPARTED, AND NOW WITH
CHRIST.</span></h2>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smcap">The</span>
oversight and neglect of our duty concerning
the souls of the blessed, now with Christ, doth much
harden the papists in their erroneous excesses here
about.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_185" id="Ref_185" href="#Foot_185">[185]</a></span>
And if we will ever reduce them, or rightly
confute them, it must be by a judicious asserting of
the truth, and observing so much with them as is
our duty, and commending that in them which is to
be commended, and not by running away from truth
and duty that we may get far enough from them and
error: for error is an ill way of confuting error.
The practical truth lieth in these following precepts.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Remember that the departed souls in
heaven are part, and the noblest part, of the body of
Christ and family of God, of which you are inferior
members; and therefore that you owe them greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">{619}</a></span>
love and honour, than you owe to any saints on
earth. "The whole family in heaven and earth is
named of Christ," Ephes. iii. 15. Those are the
happiest and noblest parts, that are most pure and
perfect, and dwell in the highest and most glorious
habitations, nearest unto Christ, yea, with him. If
holiness be lovely, the most holy are the most lovely;
we have many obligations therefore, to love them
more than the saints on earth: they are more excellent
and amiable, and Christ loveth them more. And
if any be honourable, it must especially be those spirits
that are of greatest excellencies and perfections,
and advanced to the greatest glory and nearness to
their Lord. Make conscience therefore of this as
your duty, not only to love and honour blessed souls,
but to love and honour them more than those that
are yet on earth. And as every duty is attended
with benefit, so we shall find this exceeding benefit
in the performance of this duty, that it will incline
our hearts to be the more heavenly, and draw up
our desires to the society which we so much love
and honour.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Remember that it is a part of the life
of faith, to see by it the heavenly society of the
blessed, and a part of your heavenly conversation,
to have frequent, serious, and delightful thoughts of
those crowned souls that are with Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_186" id="Ref_186" href="#Foot_186">[186]</a></span>
Otherwise
God would never have given us such descriptions
of the heavenly Jerusalem, and told us so much
of the hosts of God that must inhabit it for ever;
that must come from the "east and from the west,
and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the
kingdom of God." When it is said that our conversation
(<span title="politeuma">πολίτευμα</span>) is in heaven, Phil. iii. 20, the
meaning extendeth both to our relation, privileges,
and converse: we are denizens or citizens of the
heavenly society; and our title to their happiness
is our highest privilege and honour; and therefore
our daily business is there, and our sweetest and
most serious converse is with Christ and all those
blessed spirits. Whatever we are doing here, our
eye and heart should still be there: for we look not
at the temporal things which are seen, but at the
eternal things which are not seen, 2&nbsp;Cor. iv. 18. A
wise christian that hath forsaken the kingdom of
darkness, will be desirous to know what the kingdom
of Christ is into which he is translated, and who are
his fellow-subjects, and what are their several ranks
and dignities, so far as tendeth to his congruous converse
with them all. And how should it affect us to
find that "we are come unto mount Zion, and unto
the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general
assembly and church of the firstborn, which
are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all,
and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and to
Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant!" Heb. xii.
22-24. Live then as the members of this society,
and exclude not the chief members from your thoughts
and converse: though our local, visible communion
be only with these rural, inferior inhabitants, and
not with the courtiers of the King of heaven, yet
our mental communion may be much with them. If
our home and treasure be there with them, our hearts
will be there also, Matt. vi. 21.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. It is the will of God that the memory
of the saints be honoured on earth when they are
dead. It is some part of his favour which he hath
promised to them. Prov. x. 7, "The memory of the
just is blessed; but the name of the wicked shall
rot." Matt. xxvi. 13, "Verily I say unto you, wheresoever
this gospel shall be preached in the whole
world, there shall also this that this woman hath
done, be told for a memorial of her." The history
of the Scripture recordeth the lives of the saints to
their perpetual honour. And God will have it so
also for the sake of his abused servants upon earth,
that they may see that the slanders of malicious
tongues shall not be able to obscure the glory of his
grace, and that the lies of the ungodly prevail but
for a moment. And God will have it so for the sake
of the ungodly, that they may be ashamed of their
malicious enmity and lies against the godly, while
they perceive that the departed saints do leave behind
them a surviving testimony of their sanctity
and innocency, sufficient to confound the venomous
calumnies of the serpent's seed. Yea, God will have
the names of his eminent servants to be honoured
upon earth, for the honour of their Head, and of his
grace and gospel; so that while malice would cast
dishonour upon Christ; from the meanness and failings
of his servants that are alive, the memory of
the dead (who were once as much despised and
slandered) shall rise up against them to his honour
and their shame. And it is very observable how
God constraineth the bitter enemies of holiness to
bear this testimony for the honour of holiness against
themselves! that many who are the cruelest persecutors
and murderers of the living saints, do honour
the dead even to excess.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_187" id="Ref_187" href="#Foot_187">[187]</a></span>
How zealous are the
papists for the multitude of their holidays, and the
honouring of their names and relics, and pretending
many miracles to be wrought by a very touch of
their shrines or bones, whilst they revile and murder
those that imitate them, and deprive temporal
lords of their dominions that will not exterminate
them. Yea, while they burn the living saints, they
make it part of their crime or heresy, that they
honour not the days and relics of the dead, so much
as they; to show us that the things that have been
shall be, and that wickedness is the same in all
generations. Matt. xxiii. 29-33, "Woe unto you,
scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build
the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres
of the righteous, and say, If we had been in the
days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers
with them in the blood of the prophets.
Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye
are the children of them which killed the prophets.
Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Ye
serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape
the damnation of hell?" I know that neither did
the Pharisees, nor do the papists, believe that those
whom they murdered were saints, but deceivers and
heretics, and the troublers of the world; but if
charity be the grace most necessary to salvation,
then sure it will not keep any man from damnation,
that he had malice and uncharitableness sufficient to
persuade him, that the members of Christ were
children of the devil. But thus God will force even
the persecutors and haters of his saints to honour
them. And if he constrain his enemies to it, his
servants should not be backward to do it according
to his will.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Only such honour must be given to
departed saints, as subserveth the honour of God;
and nothing must be ascribed to them that is his
prerogative. All that of God which was communicated
to them and appeared in them, must be acknowledged;
but so that God must still be acknowledged
the spring of all; and no honour given ultimately
to them; but it is God in them that we must
behold and love, admire and honour.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. The honour of the saints departed must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">{620}</a></span>
be only such as tendeth to the promoting of holiness
among the living. It is a most horrid aggravation
of those men's sins, who make their honouring of
the saints departed a cover for their hating and persecuting
their followers; or that make it an engine
for the carrying on some base design. Some make
it a device for the advancing of their parties and peculiar
opinions. The papists make it a very great
means for the maintaining the usurped power of the
pope, giving him the power of canonizing saints, and
assuring the world what souls are in heaven. A
pope that by the testimony of a general council
(as Joh. 23. Eugenius, &amp;c.) is a heretic, and a wicked
wretch, and never like to come to heaven himself,
can assure the world of a very large catalogue of persons
that are there. And he that by the papists is
confessed fallible in matters of fact, pretendeth to
know so certainly who were saints, as to appoint
them holidays, and command the church to pray to
them. And he that teacheth men that they cannot
be certain themselves of their salvation, pretendeth
when they are dead that he is certain that they are
saved. To pretend the veneration of saints for such
carnal, ambitious designs, and cheats, and cruelties,
is a sin unfit for any that mentioneth a saint. So is it
when men pretend that saints are some rare, extraordinary
persons among the living members of the
church;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_188" id="Ref_188" href="#Foot_188">[188]</a></span>
to make men believe that honouring them
will serve instead of imitating them; and that all are
not saints that go to heaven. God forbid, say they,
that none but holy persons should be saved; we confess
it is good to be saints, and they are the chief in
heaven; but we hope those that are no saints may
be saved for all that. But God saith, "that without
holiness none shall see him," Heb. xii. 14. Heaven
is the inheritance of none but saints, Acts xxvi. 18;
Col. i. 12. He that extolleth saints to make men
believe that those that are no saints may be saved,
doth serve the devil by honouring the saints. The
same I may say of those that give them divine
honour, ascribing to each a power to hear and help
all throughout the world that put up prayers to
them.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Look up to the blessedness of departed
souls, as members of the same body, rejoicing
with them, and praising God that hath so exalted
them. This is the benefit of holy love and christian
unity, that it maketh our brethren's happiness to be
unto us, in a manner, as if it were our own. 1&nbsp;Cor. xii.
25, 26, "That there should be no schism in the body,
but that the members should have the same care one
for another&mdash;that if one member be honoured all the
members rejoice with it." So far as selfishness is
overcome, and turned into the uniting love of saints,
so far are all the joys of the blessed souls in heaven
become the joys of all that truly love them upon
earth. How happy then is the state of all true believers,
that have so many to rejoice with! Deny
not God that thanks for the saving of so many souls,
which you would not deny him, if he saved but your
friends, estates, or lives. Especially when afflictions
or temptations would deprive you of the joy which
you should have in God's mercies to yourselves, then
comfort yourselves with the remembrance of your
brethren's joy. What an incongruous, indecent thing
is it for that man to pine away in sorrows upon earth,
who hath so many thousand friends in heaven, in
joy and blessedness, whose joys should all be to him
as his own.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. When you feel a cooling of your love
to God, or of your zeal, or reverence, or other graces,
think then of the temper of those holy souls, that
see his glory! O think, with what fervour do they
love their God! with what transporting sweetness
do they delight in him! with what reverence do
they all behold him! And am not I his servant,
and a member of his family, as well as they? Shall
I be like the strangers of this frozen world, when I
should be like my fellow-citizens above? As it will
dispose a man to weep to see the tears and grief of
others; and as it will dispose a man to mirth and
joy to see the mirth and joy of others; so is it a
potent help to raise the soul to the love of God, and
delight in his service, to think believingly of the love
and delight of such a world of blessed spirits.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. When you draw near to God in his
holy worship, remember that you are part of the
same society with those blessed spirits that are
praising him in perfection. Remember that you are
members of the same choir, and your part must go
to make up the melody; and therefore you should
be as little discordant from them as possibly you can.
The quality of those that we join with in God's service,
is apt either to dull or quicken us, to depress
or elevate us; and we move heavenward most easily
and swiftly in that company which is going thither
on the swiftest pace. A believing thought that we
are worshipping God in concert with the heavenly
choir, and of the high and holy raptures of those
spirits, in the continual praise of their great Creator,
is an excellent means to warm and quicken us, and
raise us as near their holy frame, as here on earth
may be expected.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. When you would possess your hearts
with a lively sense of the odiousness of sin, and
would resist all temptations which would draw you
to it, think then how the blessed souls with God do
judge of sin, and how they would entertain such a
temptation, if the motion were made to them! What
think they of covetousness, pride, or lust? What
think they of malice, cruelty, or lying? How would
they entertain it, if lands and lordships, pleasure or
preferment, were offered them to entice their hearts
from God? Would they venture upon damnation for
a whore, or for their games, or to please their appetites?
Do they set as light by God and their salvation
as the ungodly world doth? O with what scorn
and holy indignation would they refuse a world, if it
were offered them instead of God! with what detestation
would they reject the motion to any sin!</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. When you would revive in your minds
a right apprehension and estimation of all earthly
things, as riches, and honours, and greatness, and
command, and full provisions for the flesh, bethink
you then how the blessed souls with Christ
esteem them. How little do they set by all those
things that worldlings make so great a stir for, and
for which they sell their God and their salvation!
How contemptible are crowns and kingdoms in their
eyes! Their judgment is more like to God's than ours
is. Luke xvi. 15, "That which is highly esteemed
among men is abomination in the sight of God." All
the world would not hire a saint in heaven to tell one
lie, or take the name of God in vain, or to forget
God, or be estranged from him for one hour.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. When you see the godly under the
contempt of sinners here, accounted as the filth of
the world, and the offscouring of all things,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_189" id="Ref_189" href="#Foot_189">[189]</a></span>
defamed,
reviled, hated, and persecuted, look up then to the
saints with Christ, and think how they are esteemed
and used. And when you would truly know what a
believer is, think not how they are esteemed and
used by men, but how they are esteemed and used by
Christ. Judge not of them by their short afflictions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">{621}</a></span>
nor by their meanness in the flesh, but by their endless
happiness and their glory above. Look up to
the home and world of saints, if you would know
what saints are, and not to the few, scattered, imperfect
passengers in this world, that are not worthy
of them, Heb. xi. 38.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. When you are tempted to think
meanly of the kingdom of Christ, as if his flock were
so small, and poor, and sinful as to be inconsiderable,
look up to the world of blessed souls which dwell
above. And there you shall see no such paucity, or
imperfections, or blemishes, as here below. The
subjects there are such as dishonour not their King.
Christ's kingdom is not of this world, John xviii. 36.
If you would know it in its glory, look up to the
world where it is glorious. If when you hear men
contemn the kingdom of the saints of Christ, and at
the same time did but see (as Stephen did) a glimpse
into that kingdom, and all the glory of the blessed
there, what thoughts would you have of the words
which did dishonour it?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. When you hear sinners boast of the
wisdom or numbers of their party, and appealing to
the learned or great ones of the world, look up to
the blessed souls with Christ, and ask whether they
are not more wise and numerous than all the sinners
upon earth. The greatest doctors are ignorant and
unlearned in comparison of the meanest soul with
Christ: the greatest monarchs are but worms in
comparison of the glorified spirits with God. If
they say to you, Are you wiser than so many and so
wise and learned men? ask them, Are you, or all
the ungodly, wiser than all the blessed souls with
Christ? Let the wiser party carry it.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. When you are tempted to be weary
of a holy life, or to think all your labour is vain,
look up to the blessed souls with Christ, and there
you will see the end of holiness. There you will
see that of all the labour of your lives, there is none
that you are so sure to gain by; and that in "due time
you shall reap, if you faint not: and if you sow to
the Spirit, of the Spirit you shall reap everlasting
life," Gal. vi. 8, 9; and that when you have "done
the will of God," if you "have but patience, you
shall inherit the promise," Heb. x. 36. Ask yourselves,
whether any of those blessed souls repent
now of the holiness of their lives on earth? or their
mortifying the flesh, and denying themselves the delights
of sin?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XV. When you are tempted to turn back
in the day of trial, and to forsake Christ or his
cause when persecution ariseth, then look to the
blessed souls above, and see what is the end of suffering
for the sake of Christ and righteousness. To
foresee the great reward in heaven, will convince
you that instead of being terrified by sufferings, you
should "rejoice and be exceeding glad," Matt. v.
11, 12. Are you to lie in prison, or to burn in the
flames? so did many thousands that are now in
heaven. And do you think that they repent it now?
Ignatius, Polycarp, Cyprian, and many such holy
men, were once used as hardly as you are now, and
put to death by cruel men. Rogers, Bradford,
Hooper, Glover, and multitudes with them, were
once in prison and burnt in the flames; but where
are they now, and what is the end of all their pains?
Now whether do you think the case of Bonner or
Bradford to be best? Now had you rather be Gardiner
or Philpot? Now which think you doth most
repent, the poor Waldenses that were murdered by
thousands, or the popes and persecutors that murdered
them?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVI. When you are dismayed under the
burden of your sins, the greatness of your corruptions,
the weakness of your graces, the imperfection
of your duties, look up to the blessed souls with
Christ, and remember that all those glorified spirits
were once in flesh as you now are, and once they lay
at the feet of God, in tears, and groans, and cries, as
you do: they were once fain to cry out of the burden
of their sins, and mourn under the weakness
of their graces, as you now do. They were once as
much clogged with flesh as you are; and once as
low in doubts and fears, and bruised under the sense
of God's displeasure. They once were as violently
assaulted with temptations, and had the same corruptions
to lament and strive against as you have.
They were once as much afflicted by God and man;
but is there any of the smart of this remaining?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVII. When you are deterred from the
presence of the dreadful God, and think he will not
accept such worms as you, look up to the blessed
souls with Christ; and remember how many millions
of your brethren are there accepted to greater
familiarity than that which you here desire. Remember
that those souls were once as dark and distant
from God, and unworthy of his acceptance, as
you now are. A fearful child receiveth boldness, to
see his brethren in his father's arms.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVIII. When you are afraid of Satan lest
he should prevail against you and devour you, look
up to the blessed souls with Christ; and see how
many millions are there safely landed, that once
were in as dangerous a station as you are. Through
many tribulations and temptations they are arrived at
the heavenly rest: Satan once did his worst against
them: they were tossed on the seas of this tempestuous
world; but they were kept by the power of
God, through faith unto salvation, and so may you.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIX. When you would duly value all your
present means and mercies, and see whither they
tend, look up then to the souls with Christ, and see
whither the like mercy hath conducted them. The
poorest cottage and the hardest fare are great mercies,
as they tend to endless blessedness. This now
and heaven after, is great, though the thing in itself
be never so small. Heaven puts the value and signification
upon all your mercies. The wicked make
ciphers of their greatest blessings, by separating
them in their esteem and use, from God and heaven,
which is the measure of their estimate.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XX. When you see divisions among believers,
and hear one for this party, and another for
that, and hear them bitterly censuring each other,
look up then to the saints with Christ, and think
what perfect love, and peace, and concord is among
them. Consider how unlike our factions and schisms
are to their fervent love and unity; and how unlike
our jarring strifes and quarrels are to their harmonious
praise of God. Remember in what work it is
that they are so happily united, even love and praise
incessant to Jehovah: and then think, whether it
would not unite the saints on earth, to lay by their
contendings for the pre-eminence in knowledge,
(covered with the gilded name of zeal for the truth
of God,) and to employ themselves in love and praise,
and to show their emulation here, in striving who
shall love God and each other with the more pure
heart and fervent love, 1&nbsp;Pet. i. 22, and who shall
praise him with the most heavenly alacrity and delight.
Consider whether this work of blessed souls be not like
to be more desirable and excellent, than the work of
self-conceited, wrangling sophisters. And whether
there be any danger of falling into sects and factions,
or falling out by emulations or contentions,
while we make this work of love and praise the matter
of our religious converse. And consider whether
almost all the schisms that ever vexed the church of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">{622}</a></span>
God, did not arise, either by the pastors striving
"who should be the greatest," Luke xxii. 24, 26, or
by the rising up of some sciolist or gnostic, proudly
pretending to know more than others, and to vindicate
or bring to light some excellent truth which
others know not, or oppose. And when you see the
hot contendings of each party, about their pretended
orthodoxness or wisdom, (which James iii. is purposely
written against,) remember how the concord
of those blessed souls doth shame this work, and
should make it odious to the heirs of heaven.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXI. When you are afraid of death, or
would find more willingness to die, look up to the
blessed souls with Christ, and think that you are but
to pass that way, which all those souls have gone before
you; and to go from a world of enmity and
vanity, to the company of all those blessed spirits.
And is not their blessed state more desirable than
such a vain, vexatious life as this? There is no
malice, nor slandering, nor cruel persecuting; no
uncharitable censures, contentions, or divisions; no
ignorance, nor unbelief, nor strangeness unto God;
nothing but holy, amiable, and delightful. Join
yourselves daily to that celestial society: suppose
yourselves spectators of their order, purity, and
glory, and auditors of their harmonious praises of
Jehovah. Live by faith in a daily familiarity with
them: say not that you want company or are alone,
when you may walk in the streets of the heavenly
Jerusalem, and there converse with the prophets and
apostles, and all the glorious hosts of heaven. Converse
thus with them in your life, and it will overcome
the fear of death, and make you long to be
there with them: like one that stands by the river
side, and seeth his friends on the further side, in a
place of pleasure, while his enemies are pursuing
him at his back, how gladly would he be over with
them! And it will imbolden him to venture on the
passage, which all they have safely passed before
him. Thus death will be to us as the Red sea, to
pass us safe to the land of promise, while our pursuers
are there overthrown and perish. We should
not be so strange to the world above, if we thus by
faith conversed with the blessed ones.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXII. When you are over-much troubled
for the death of your godly friends, look up to that
world of blessed souls, to which they are translated,
and think whether it be not better for them to be
there than here; and whether you are not bound by
the law of love, to rejoice with them that are thus
exalted. Had we but a sight of the world that they are
in, and the company that they are gone to, we should
be less displeased with the will of God, in disposing
of his own into so glorious a state.</p>

<p>All these improvements may be made by a believer,
of his daily converse with the souls above.
This is the communion with them which we must
hold on earth: not by praying to them, which God
hath never encouraged us to do; nor by praying for
them (for though it be lawful to pray for the resurrection
of their bodies, and the perfecting of their
blessedness thereby, yet it being a thing of absolute
certainty as the day of judgment is, we must be very
cautelous in the manner of our doing this lawful act;
it being a thing that their happiness doth not at all
depend on, and a thing which will-worshippers have
showed themselves so forward to abuse, by stepping
further into that which is unlawful; as the horrid
abuses of the names, and days, and shrines, and relics,
of real or supposed saints, in the papal kingdom,
sadly testifieth). But the necessary part of our
communion with the saints in heaven, being of so
great importance to the church on earth, I commend
it to the due consideration of the faithful, whether
our forgetfulness of it is not to be much repented of,
and whether it be not a work to be more seriously
minded for the time to come.</p>

<p>And I must confess I know not why it should be
thought unlawful to celebrate the memorial of the
life or martyrdom of any extraordinary servant of
God, by an anniversary solemnity, on a set appropriate
day: it is but to keep the thankful remembrance
of God's mercy to the church; and sure the
life and death of such is not the smallest of the
church's mercies here on earth. If it be lawful on
November the fifth to celebrate the memorial of our
deliverance from the powder-plot, I know not why
it should be thought unlawful to do the like in this
case also: provided, 1. That it be not terminated in
the honour of a saint, but of the God of saints, for
giving so great a mercy to his church. 2. That it
be not to honour a saint merely as a saint, but to
some extraordinary eminent saints: otherwise all
that go to heaven must have festivals kept in remembrance
of them; and so we might have a million
for a day. 3. That it be not made equal with
the Lord's day, but kept in such a subordination to
that day, as the life or death of saints is of inferior
and subordinate respect to the work of Christ in
man's redemption. 4. And if it be kept in a spiritual
manner, to invite men to imitate the holiness of the
saints, and the constancy of the martyrs, and not to
encourage sensuality and sloth.</p>

<span class="small">DIRECTIONS ABOUT OUR COMMUNION WITH THE HOLY ANGELS.</span></h2>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. Be satisfied in knowing so much of angels
as God in nature and Scripture hath revealed; but
presume not to inquire further, much less to determine
of unrevealed things. That there are angels,
and that they are holy spirits, is past dispute; but
what number they are, and of how many worlds, and
of what orders and different dignities and degrees,
and when they were created, and what locality belongeth
to them, and how far they excel or differ
from the souls of men, these and many other such
unnecessary questions, neither nature nor Scripture
will teach us how infallibly to resolve. Almost all
the heretics in the first ages of the church, did make
their doctrines of angels the first and chief part of
their heresies; arrogantly intruding into unrevealed
things, and boasting of their acquaintance with the
orders and inhabitants of the higher world. These
being risen in the apostles' days, occasioned Paul to
say, Col. ii. 18, "Let no man beguile you of your
reward in a voluntary humility, and worshipping
of angels, intruding into those things which he
hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly
mind."</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Understand so much of the ministry of
angels as God hath revealed, and so far take notice
of your communion with them; but affect not any
other sort of communion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_190" id="Ref_190" href="#Foot_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall here show how much of the ministry of
angels is revealed to us in Scripture.</p>

<p>1. It is part of the appointed work of angels, to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">{623}</a></span>
ministering spirits for the heirs of salvation, Heb. i. 14.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_191" id="Ref_191" href="#Foot_191">[191]</a></span>
Not ministers or servants of the godly, but ministers
of God for the godly: as the shepherd is not a servant
of the sheep, but for the sheep. It is not an accidental
or occasional work which they do extraordinarily;
but it is their undertaken office to which
they are sent forth. And this their ministry is about
the ordinary concernments of our lives, and not only
about some great or unusual cases or exigents, Psal.
xxxiv. 6, 7; xci. 11, 12.</p>

<p>2. It is not some, but all the angels that are appointed
by God to this ministration. "Are they not
all ministering spirits sent forth," &amp;c. Heb. i. 1, 4.
Mark here, that if you inquire whether God have
any higher spirits, that are not employed in so low
an office, but govern these angels, or if you inquire
whether only this world be the angels' charge, or
whether they have many other worlds also (of viators)
to take care of; neither nature nor Scripture
doth give you the determination of any of these questions;
and therefore you must leave them as unrevealed
things (with abundance more with which
the old heretics, and the popish schoolmen, have diverted
men's minds from plain and necessary things).
But that all the angels minister for us, are the express
words of Scripture.</p>

<p>3. The work of this office is not left promiscuously
among them, but several angels have their several
works and charge; therefore Scripture telleth us of
some sent on one message, and some on another;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_192" id="Ref_192" href="#Foot_192">[192]</a></span>
and tells us that the meanest of Christ's members
on earth have their angels before God in heaven: "I
say unto you, that in heaven their angels do always
behold the face of my Father which is in heaven,"
Matt. xviii. 10. Whether each true believer hath
one or more angels? and whether one angel look to
more than one believer? are questions which God
hath not resolved us of, either in nature or Scripture;
but that each true christian hath his angel, is here
asserted by our Lord.</p>

<p>4. In this office of ministration they are servants
of Christ as the Head of the church, and the Mediator
between God and man, to promote the ends of
his superior office in man's redemption.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_193" id="Ref_193" href="#Foot_193">[193]</a></span>
Matt. xxviii.
18, "All power is given to me in heaven and earth;"
John xiii. 3. Eph. i. 20-22, "And set him at his
right hand in the celestials, far above all principality,
and power, and might, and dominion, and every
name that is named, not only in this world, but also
in that which is to come, and hath put all things
under his feet, and gave him to be head over all
things to the church." Rev. xxiii. 16, "I Jesus have
sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in
the churches."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_194" id="Ref_194" href="#Foot_194">[194]</a></span>
Whether the angels were appointed
about the service of Adam in innocency; or only began
their office with Christ the Mediator as his
ministers, is a thing that God hath not revealed; but
that they serve under Christ for his church is plain.</p>

<p>5. This care of the angels for us is exercised
throughout our lives, for the saving of us from all
our dangers, and delivering us out of all our troubles.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_195" id="Ref_195" href="#Foot_195">[195]</a></span>
Psal. xxxiv. 6, 7, "This poor man cried, and the
Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles:
the angel of the Lord encampeth about them
that fear him, and delivereth them." Psal. xci. 11,
12, "For he shall give his angels charge over thee
to keep thee in all thy ways: they shall bear thee
up in their hand, lest thou dash thy foot against a
stone." In all our ways, (that are good,) and in
every step we tread, we have the care and ministry
of tutelar angels. They are our ordinary defence
and guard.</p>

<p>6. In all this ministry they perfectly obey the will
of God,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_196" id="Ref_196" href="#Foot_196">[196]</a></span>
and do nothing but by his command, Psal.
ciii. 10; Zech. i. 8, 10; Matt. xviii. 10, being his
messengers to man.</p>

<p>7. Much of their work is to oppose the malice of
evil spirits that seek our heart, and to defend us from
them;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_197" id="Ref_197" href="#Foot_197">[197]</a></span>
against whom they are engaged under
Christ in daily war or conflict, Rev. xii. 7, 9; Psal.
lxi. 17; lxxviii. 49; Matt. iv. 11.</p>

<p>8. In this their ministration they are ordered into
different degrees of superiority and inferiority,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_198" id="Ref_198" href="#Foot_198">[198]</a></span>
and
are not equal among themselves, 1&nbsp;Thess. iv. 16;
Jude 9; Dan. x. 13, 20, 21; Eph. i. 21; Col. ii.
10; Eph. iii. 10; vi. 12; Col. i. 16; Zech. iv. 10;
Rev. iv. 5; v. 6.</p>

<p>9. Angels are employed not only about our bodies,
but our souls, by furthering the means of our salvation:
they preached the gospel themselves, (as they
delivered the law,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_199" id="Ref_199" href="#Foot_199">[199]</a></span>)
Luke ii. 9, 10; i. 11, &amp;c.; Heb.
ii. 2; Gal. iii. 19; Acts x. 4; Dan. vii. 16; viii. 15-17;
ix. 21, 22; Luke i. 29; ii. 19. Especially
they deliver particular messages, which suppose the
sufficiency of the laws of Christ, and only help to
the obedience of it.</p>

<p>10. They are sometimes God's instruments to
confirm, and warn, and comfort, and excite the soul,
and to work upon the mind, and will, and affections:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_200" id="Ref_200" href="#Foot_200">[200]</a></span>
that they do this persuasively, and have as much
access and power to do us good, as Satan hath to do
us evil, is very clear. Good angels have as much
power and access to the soul, to move to duty, as
devils have to tempt to sin. As God hath sent them
oft upon monitory and consolatory messages to his
servants in visible shapes, so doth he send them on
the like messages invisibly, Judg. v. 23; Matt. i. 20;
Psal. civ. 4; Luke xxii. 43, an angel from heaven
is sent to strengthen Christ himself in his agony.</p>

<p>11. They persecute and chase the enemies of the
church, and sometimes destroy them: as Psal. xxxv.
5, 6; 2&nbsp;Kings xix. 35; Isa. xxxvii. 36; and hinder
them from doing hurt, Numb. xxii. 24.</p>

<p>12. They are a convoy for the departing souls of
the godly, to bring them to the place of their felicity,
Luke xvi. 22, though how they do it we cannot
understand.</p>

<p>13. They are the attendants of Christ at his coming
to judgment, and his ministers to gather his
elect, and sever the wicked from the just, in order to
their endless punishment or joy. 1&nbsp;Thess. iv. 16,
"The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with
a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with
the trump of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
first: then we which are alive and remain shall be
caught up," &amp;c. Matt. xiii. 41, 42, 49, "The Son of
man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather
out of his kingdom all offences or scandals, and them
which do iniquity; and shall cast them into a furnace
of fire. At the end of the world, the angels
shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among
the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of
fire," &amp;c.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_201" id="Ref_201" href="#Foot_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. Understand our near affinity or relation
to the angels, and how they and we are concerned
in each others' condition and affairs. As to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">{624}</a></span>
nature our immortal souls are kin or like unto the
angels, though our bodies are but like the brutes.
Those souls that are created after the image of God,
in their very natural essence, (as rational and free
agents,) besides his moral image of sanctity, Gen. ix.
6, may well be said to be like the angels: "He
made us a little lower than the angels," Psal. viii. 5.
And God hath made us their charge and care; and
therefore no doubt hath given them a special love
unto us, to fit them to the due performance of their
trust. As ministers have a special paternal love to
their flocks, and as christians are to have a special
love to one another to enable and engage them to
the duties appointed them by God towards each
other; so these excellent spirits have no doubt a far
purer and greater love, to the image of God upon the
saints, and to the saints for the image and sake of
God, than the dearest friends and holiest persons on
earth can have. For they are more holy, and they are
more perfectly conformed to the mind of God, and they
love God himself more perfectly than we, and therefore
for his sake do love his people much more perfectly
than we. And therefore they are more to be
loved by us than any mortals are; both because they
are more excellent, pure, and amiable, and because
they have more love to us. Moreover the angels are
servants of the same God, and members of the same
society which we belong to. They are the inhabitants
of the heavenly Jerusalem, of which we are
heirs: they have possession, and we have title, and
shall in time possess it. We are called to much of
the same employment with them; we must love the
same God, and glorify him by obedience, thanks, and
praise, and so do they. Therefore they are ministers
for our good, and rejoice in the success of their
labours, as the ministers of Christ on earth do, Heb.
i. 14. There is not a sinner converted, but it is the
angels' joy, Luke xv. 10, which showeth us how
much they attend that work. "We are come to mount
Zion, and unto the city of the living God, the
heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels," &amp;c.
Heb. xii. 22-24. They are especially present and
attendant on us in our holy assemblies and services
of God; and therefore we are admonished to reverence
their presence, and do nothing before them that
is sinful or unseemly, 1&nbsp;Cor. xi. 10; Eccles. v. 6.
The presence of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
and the elect angels, must continually awe us into
exact obedience, 1&nbsp;Tim. v. 21. With the church
they pry into the mystery of the dispensations of the
Spirit to the church, 1&nbsp;Pet. i. 12. And so "by the
church," that is, by God's dealings with the church,
is "made known the manifold wisdom of God," even
to these "heavenly principalities and powers," Eph.
iii. 10. In conclusion, Christ telleth us that in our
state of blessedness we shall "be equal to the
angels," Luke xx. 36, and so shall live with them
for ever.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. When your thoughts of heaven are
staggering or strange, and when you are tempted to
doubt whether indeed there is such a life of glory
for the saints, it may be a great help to your faith,
to think of the world of angels that already do possess
it. That there are such excellent and happy
inhabitants of the superior orbs, besides what Scripture
saith, even reason will strongly persuade any
rational man: 1. When we consider that sea, and
land, and air, and all places of this lower, baser part
of the world, are replenished with inhabitants suitable
to their natures; and therefore that the incomparably
more great and excellent orbs and regions
should all be uninhabited, is irrational to imagine.
2. And as we see the rational creatures are made to
govern the brutes in this inferior world, so reason
telleth us it is improbable that the higher reason of
the inhabitants of the higher regions should have no
hand in the government of man. And yet God hath
further condescended to satisfy us herein, by some
unquestionable apparitions of good angels, and many
more of evil spirits, which puts the matter past all
doubt, that there are inhabitants of the unseen world.
And when we know that such there are, it maketh
it the more easy to us to believe that such we may
be, either numbered with the happy or unhappy
spirits, considering the affinity which there is between
the nature of our souls and them: to conquer
senseless Sadducism is a good step to the conquest
of irreligiousness; he that is well persuaded that
there are angels and spirits, is much better prepared
than a Sadducee to believe the immortality of the
soul: and because the infinite distance between God
and man, is apt to make the thoughts of our approaching
his glory either dubious or very terrible,
the remembrance of those myriads of blessed spirits
that dwell now in the presence of that glory, doth
much imbolden and confirm our thoughts; as he
that would be afraid whether he should have access
to and acceptance with the king, would be much encouraged
if he saw a multitude as mean as himself,
or not much unlike him, to be familiar attendants on
him. I must confess such is my own weakness, that
I find a frequent need of remembering the holy
hosts of saints and angels, that are with God, to imbolden
my soul, and make the thoughts of heaven
more familiar and sweet, by abating my strangeness,
amazedness, and fears; and thus far to make them
the media (that I say not the mediators) of my
thoughts, in their approaches to the most high and
holy God (though the remembrance of Christ the
true Mediator is my chief encouragement). Especially
when we consider how fervently those holy
spirits do love every holy person upon earth, and so
that all those that dwell with God, are dearer friends
to us, than our fathers or mothers here on earth are,
(as is briefly proved before,) this will imbolden us
yet much more.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. Make use of the thoughts of the angelical
hosts, when you would see the glory and majesty
of Christ. If you think it a small matter that
he is the Head of the church on earth, a handful of
people contemned by the satanical party of the world,
yet think what it is to be "Head over all things, far
above all principality, and power, and might, and
dominion, and every name that is named, not only in
this world, but also in that which is to come," (that
is, gave him a power, dignity, and name, greater than
any power, dignity, or name of men or angels,) "and
hath put all things under his feet," Eph. i. 21-23.
"Being made so much better than the angels, as he
hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name
than they;" of him it is said, "Let all the angels of
God worship him," Heb. i. 4, 6. Read the whole
chapter. Our Head is the Lord of all these hosts.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Make use of the remembrance of the
glorious angels, to acquaint you with the dignity of
human nature, and the special dignity of the servants
of God, and so to raise up your hearts in
thankfulness to your Creator and Redeemer who
hath thus advanced you.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_202" id="Ref_202" href="#Foot_202">[202]</a></span>
1. What a dignity is it
that these holy angels should be all ministering
spirits sent for our good! that they should love us,
and concern themselves so much for us, as to rejoice
in heaven at our conversion! "Lord, what is man,
that thou art mindful of him, and the son of man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">{625}</a></span>
that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a
little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him
with glory and honour," Psal. viii. 4, 5. 2. But yet
it is a higher declaration of our dignity, that we
should in heaven be equal with them, and so be
numbered into their society, and join with them
everlastingly in the praise of our Creator. 3. And
it is yet a greater honour to us, that our natures are
assumed into union of person with the Son of God,
and so advanced above the angels. "For he took
not on him the nature of angels, but the seed of
Abraham:" nor hath he put the world to come in
subjection to the angels, Heb. ii. 5, 16. This is the
Lord's doing, and it is wondrous in our eyes.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. When you would admire the works
of God and his government, look specially to the
angels' part. If God would be glorified in his works,
then especially in the most glorious parts: if he
take delight to work by instruments, and to communicate
such excellency and honour to them as may
conduce to the honour of the principal cause, we
must not overlook their excellency and honour, unless
we will deny God the honour which is due to
him. As he that will see the excellent workmanship
of a watch or any other engine, must not overlook
the chiefest parts, nor their operation on the rest;
so he that will see the excellent order of the works
and government of God, must not overlook the
angels, nor their offices in the government, and preservation
of the inferior creatures, so far as God hath
revealed it unto us. We spoil the music if we leave
out these strings. It is a great part of the glory of
the works of God, that all the parts in heaven and
earth are so admirably conjoined and jointed as they
are; and each in their places contribute to the
beauty and harmony of the whole.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. When you would be apprehensive
of the excellency of love and humility, and exact
obedience to the will of God, look up to the angels,
and see the lustre of all these virtues as they shine
in them. How perfectly do they love God and all
his saints! even the weakest and meanest of the
members of Christ! With what humility do they
condescend to minister for the heirs of salvation!
how readily and perfectly do they obey their Maker!<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_203" id="Ref_203" href="#Foot_203">[203]</a></span>
Though our chiefest pattern is Christ himself, who
came nearer to us, and appeared in flesh, to give us
the example of all such duties, yet under him the
example of angels is also to be observed, and with
pleasure to be imitated. And ask the enemies of
holiness, who urge you with the examples of the
great and learned, whether they are wiser than all
the angels of God?</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. When you are tempted to desire any
inordinate communion with angels, as visibly appearing
or affecting your senses, or to give them any
part of the office or honour of Jesus Christ, then
think how suitable that office is to your safety and
benefit which God hath assigned them, and how
much they themselves abhor aspiring to, or usurpation
of, the office or honour of their Lord: and consider
how much more suitable to your benefit this
spiritual ministration of the angels is, than if they
appeared to us in bodily shapes.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_204" id="Ref_204" href="#Foot_204">[204]</a></span>
In this spiritual
communion they act according to their spiritual nature,
without deceit; and they serve us without
any terrible appearances; and without any danger
of drawing us to sensitive, gross apprehensions of
them, or enticing us to an unmeet adhesion to them,
or honouring of them: whereas if they appeared to
us in visible shapes, we might easily be affrighted,
confounded, and left in doubt, whether they were
good angels indeed or not. It is our communion
with God himself that is our happiness; and communion
with angels or saints, is desirable but in order
unto this: that kind of communion with angels
therefore is the best, which most advanceth us to
communion with God; and that reception of his
mercy by instruments is best, which least endangereth
our inordinate adhesion to the instruments, and
our neglect of God. We know not so well as God,
what way is best and safest for us: as it is dangerous
desiring to mend his word by any fancies of our
own, which we suppose more fit; so it is dangerous
to desire to amend his government, and providence,
and order, and to think that another way than that
which in nature he hath stated and appointed, is more
to our benefit. It is dangerous wishing God to
go out of his way, and to deal with us, and conduct
us in by-ways of our own; in which we are ourselves
unskilled, and of which we little know the
issue.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. When you are apt to be terrified with
the fear of devils, think then of the guard of angels,
and how much greater strength is for you than
against you. Though God be our only fundamental
security, and our chiefest confidence must be
in him, yet experience telleth us how apt we are to
look to instruments, and to be affected as second
causes do appear to make for us or against us;
therefore when appearing dangers terrify us, appearing
or secondary helps should be observed to comfort
and encourage us.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. Labour to answer the great and holy
love of angels with such great and holy love to them,
as may help you against your unwillingness to die, and
make you long for the company of them whom you so
much love. And when death seemeth terrible to you
because the world to come seems strange, remember
that you are going to the society of those angels,
that rejoiced in your conversion, and ministered for
you here on earth, and are ready to convoy your
souls to Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_205" id="Ref_205" href="#Foot_205">[205]</a></span>
Though the thoughts of God and
our blessed Mediator should be the only final object
to attract our love, and make us long to be in heaven,
yet under Christ, the love and company of saints and
angels must be thought on to further our desires and
delight: for even in heaven God will not so be all to
us, as to use no creature for our comfort; otherwise
the glorified humanity of Christ would be no means
of our comfort there; and the heavenly Jerusalem
would not then have been set out to us by its created
excellencies, as it is Rev. xxi. xxii.; nor would it
be any comfort to us in the kingdom of God that we
shall be with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Luke xiii.
28; Matt. viii. 11.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. Pray for the protection and help of
angels, as part of the benefits procured for the saints
by Christ; and be thankful for it as a privilege of
believers, excelling all the dignities of the ungodly.
And walk with a reverence of their presence, especially
in the worshipping of God. It is not fit such
a mercy should be undervalued or unthankfully received:
nor that so ordinary a means of our preservation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">{626}</a></span>
should be overlooked, and not be sought of
God by prayer. But the way to keep the love of
angels, is to keep up the love of God; and the way
to please them, is to please him; for his will is theirs.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. In all the worship you perform to
God, remember that you join with the angels of
heaven, and bear your part to make up the concert.
Do it therefore with that holiness, and reverence,
and affection, as remembering not only to whom you
speak, but also what companions you have; and let
there not be too great a discord either in your hearts
or praises. O think with what lively, joyful minds
they praise their glorious Creator; and how unwearied
they are in their most blessed work! And
labour to be like them in love and praise, that you
may come to be equal with them in their glory,
Luke xx. 36.</p>

<h2>CASES OF CONSCIENCE,<br /><br />
<span class="small">ABOUT</span><br /><br />
MATTERS ECCLESIASTICAL.</h2>

<hr />

<h3 class="reader">Reader,</h3>

<p class="nodent">I have something to say to thee of the number of these cases, somewhat
of the order, and somewhat of the manner of handling and resolving
them. I. That they are so many is because there are really so many
difficulties which all men are not able to resolve. That they are no
more, is partly because I could not remember then any more that were
necessarily to be handled, and I was not willing to increase so great
a book with things unnecessary.</p>

<p>II. As to the order, I have some reasons for the order of most of
them, which would be too tedious to open to you. But some of them are
placed out of order, because, 1. I could not remember them in due
place. 2. And great haste allowed me not time to transpose them. If
you say that in such a work I should take time, I answer, You are no
competent judges, unless you knew me and the rest of my work, and the
likelihood that my time will be but short. They that had rather take
my writings with such defects which are the effects of haste, than
have none of them, may use them, and the rest are free to despise them
and neglect them. Two or three questions about the Scripture, I would
have put nearer the beginning if I could have time; but seeing I
cannot, it is easy for you to transpose them in the reading.</p>

<p>III. The resolution of these cases so much avoideth all the extremes,
that I look they should be displeasing to all that vast number of
christians, who involve themselves in the opinions and interests of
their several sects as such, and that hold the faith of our Lord Jesus
Christ with respect of persons. But there will be still a certain
number of truly catholic, impartial readers, whose favourable
acceptance I confidently prognosticate; and who, being out of the
dust, and noise, and passions of contending sides and parties, and
their interests, will see a self-evidencing light in those solutions,
which are put off here briefly, without the pomp of formal
argumentation, or persuading oratory. The Eternal Light revealeth
himself to us, by Christ who is the Light of the world, and by the
illumination of the Spirit and word of light; that we may walk in the
light, as the children of light, till we come to the world of glorious
everlasting light. And what other defect soever our knowledge have, if
any man hath knowledge enough to kindle in him the love of God, the
same is known of him, and therefore is beloved by him, and shall be
blessed with and in him for ever, 1&nbsp;Cor. viii. 1-3.</p>

<h3>Quest. I. <i>How to know which is the true church, among all
pretenders, that a christian's conscience may be quiet in his relation
and communion.</i></h3>

<p>I have written so much of this already in four books,
(viz. one called, "The Safe Religion," another called,
"A Key for Catholics," another called, "The
Visibility of the Church," another called, "A true
Catholic, and the Catholic Church described,") that
I shall say now but a little, and yet enough to an
impartial, considerate reader.</p>

<p>The terms must first be opened. 1. By a church
is meant a society of christians as such. And it is
sometimes taken narrowly, for the body or members
as distinct from the head, as the word kingdom is
taken for the subjects only as distinct from the king;
and sometimes more fully and properly for the whole
political society, as constituted of its head and body,
or the <i>pars imperans et pars subdita</i>.</p>

<p>2. The word church thus taken, signifieth sometimes
the universal church called catholic, which
consisteth of Christ and his body politic, or mystical;
and sometimes some part only of the universal
church. And so it is taken either for a subordinate,
political part, or for a community, or a part considered
as consociate, but not political; or as many
particular, political churches agreeing and holding
concord and communion without any common head,
save the universal Head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">{627}</a></span>
3. Such political churches are either of divine
constitution and policy, or only of human.</p>

<p>2. By christians, I mean such as profess the essentials
of the christian religion. For we speak of
the church as visible.</p>

<p>3. By true, may be meant, either reality of essence,
opposite to that which is not really a church in
this univocal acception; or else sound and orthodox,
in the integrals, as opposite to erroneous and
defiled with much enormity. And now I thus decide
that question.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> I. The true catholic church consisteth of
Christ the Head, and all christians as his body, or
the members. As the kingdom consisteth of the
king and his subjects.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_206" id="Ref_206" href="#Foot_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> II. As all the sincere heart-covenanters
make up the church as regenerate, and mystical or
invisible; so all that are christened, that is, baptized,
and profess consent to all the essentials of the
baptismal covenant, not having apostatized, nor
being by lawful power excommunicated, are christians,
and make up the church as visible.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_207" id="Ref_207" href="#Foot_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> III. Therefore there is but one universal
church, because it containeth all christians; and so
leaveth out none to be the matter of another.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_208" id="Ref_208" href="#Foot_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> IV. It is not ignorance or error about the
mere integrals of christianity, which maketh them
no christians who hold the essentials, that is, the
baptismal covenant.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_209" id="Ref_209" href="#Foot_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> V. That the baptismal covenant might be
rightly understood and professed, the churches have
still used the creed as the explication of the covenant,
in point of faith; and taken it for the symbol
of the christian belief. And no further profession
of faith was or is to be required, as necessary to the
being of christianity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_210" id="Ref_210" href="#Foot_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> VI. If proud usurpers or censurers take on
them to excommunicate, or unchristian, or unchurch
others, without authority and cause, this maketh
them not to be no christians, or no churches, that are
so used.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_211" id="Ref_211" href="#Foot_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> VII. Therefore to know which is the true
catholic or universal church, is but to know who are
baptized, professed christians.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_212" id="Ref_212" href="#Foot_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> VIII. The reformed churches, the Lutherans,
the Abassines, the Coptics, the Syrians, the Armenians,
the Jacobites, the Georgians, the Maronites,
the Greeks, the Moscovites, and the Romanists, do
all receive baptism in all its visible essentials, and
profess all the essentials of the christian religion,
though not with the same integrity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_213" id="Ref_213" href="#Foot_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> IX. He that denieth any one essential part,
in itself, is so a heretic as to be no christian, nor true
member of the church, if it be justly proved or notorious:
that is, none ought to take him for a visible
christian, who know the proof of his denying that
essential part of christianity, or to whom it is notorious.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_214" id="Ref_214" href="#Foot_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> X. He that holdeth the essentials primarily,
and with them holdeth some error which by unseen
consequence subverteth some essential point, but
holdeth the essentials so much faster, that he would
forsake his error if he saw the inconsistence, is a
christian notwithstanding; and if the name heretic
be applicable to him, it is but in such a sense, as is
consistent with christianity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_215" id="Ref_215" href="#Foot_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XI. He that is judged a heretic and no
christian justly by others, must be lawfully cited, and
heard plead his cause, and be judged upon sufficient
proof, and not unheard, or upon rash presumption.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_216" id="Ref_216" href="#Foot_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XII. Christianity and heresy being personal
qualities, and no where found but in individuals, nor
one man guilty of another's error, it followeth that
it is single persons upon personal guilt that must be
judged.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_217" id="Ref_217" href="#Foot_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XIII. Any man may judge another to be a
christian or heretic, by a private judgment of discerning,
or the reason which guideth all human actions;
but only church rulers may judge him by that public
judgment, which giveth or denieth him his public
privileges and communion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_218" id="Ref_218" href="#Foot_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XIV. If by notorious injustice church rulers
condemn christians as no christians, though they
may thereby deny them communion with those public
assemblies which they govern, yet do they not
oblige the people to take such injured persons for no
christians. Else they might oblige all to believe a
lie, to consent to malicious injuries, and might disoblige
the people from truth, righteousness, and
charity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_219" id="Ref_219" href="#Foot_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XV. There is no one natural or collective
head and governor of all the churches in the world
(the universal church) but Jesus Christ; and therefore
there is none that by such governing power, can
excommunicate any man out of the universal church;
and such usurpation would be treason against Christ,
whose prerogative it is.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_220" id="Ref_220" href="#Foot_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XVI. Yet he that deserveth to be excommunicated
from one church, deserveth to be excommunicated
by and from all, if it be upon a cause
common to all; or that nullifieth his christianity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_221" id="Ref_221" href="#Foot_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XVII. And where neighbour churches are
consociate and live in order and concord, he that is
orderly excommunicate from one church, and it be
notified to the rest, should not be taken into the communion
of any of the rest, till he be cleared, or become
fit for their communion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_222" id="Ref_222" href="#Foot_222">[222]</a></span>
But this obligation
ariseth but from the concord of consociate churches,
and not from the power of one over the rest; and it
cannot reach all the world, where the person cometh
not, nor was ever known; but only to those who
through neighbourhood are capable of just notice,
and of giving or denying communion to that person.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XVIII. From all this it is clear, that it is
not either papists alone, or Greeks alone, or protestants
alone, or any party of christians, who are the
universal church, seeing that church containeth all
christians.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_223" id="Ref_223" href="#Foot_223">[223]</a></span>
And that reviling others (yea, whole
nations) as heretics, schismatics, and no christians
or churches, will no more prove the revilers to be
the only church or christians, than want of love will
prove a man to be one of Christ's disciples, who by
love are known to all men to be his.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XIX. It is therefore the shameful language
of distracted men, to cry out against other christian
nations, It is not you, but we that are the catholic
or universal church. And our shameful controversy,
which of them is the catholic, is no wiser than to
question, Whether it be this house or that which is
the street? Or this street or that which is the city?
Or whether it be the kitchen, or the hall, or the parlour
which is the house? Or the hand, or foot, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">{628}</a></span>
eye which is the man? O when will God bring distracting
teachers to repentance, and distracted people
to their wits?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_224" id="Ref_224" href="#Foot_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XX. There is great difference in the purity
or soundness of the several parts of the universal
church; some being more orthodox and holy, and
some defiled with so many errors and sins, as to
make it difficult to discern whether they do not deny
the very essentials.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_225" id="Ref_225" href="#Foot_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXI. The reformed churches are the soundest
and purest that we know in the world, and therefore
their privilege exceeding great, though they are
not all the universal church.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXII. Particular churches consisting of
lawful pastors and christian people associated for
personal communion in worship and holy living, are
societies or true churches of Christ's institution, and
the chief parts of the universal church; as cities
and corporations are of the kingdom.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_226" id="Ref_226" href="#Foot_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXIII. There are thousands of these in the
world, and a man may be saved in one, as well as in
another; only the purest give him the best advantages
for his salvation; and therefore should be preferred
by all that are wise and love their souls, so
far as they are free to choose their communion.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXIV. The case then being easily resolved,
(which is the true church?) viz. All christians as
christians are the catholic or universal church;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_227" id="Ref_227" href="#Foot_227">[227]</a></span>
and
all congregations afore described, of true pastors
and christians, being particular true churches, differing
only in degrees of purity, he is to be suspected
as a designing deceiver and troubler of the world,
that pretending to be a learned man and a teacher,
doth still perplex the consciences of the ignorant
with this frivolous question, and would muddy and
obscure this clear state of the case, lest the people
should rest in the discerned truth.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXV. The papal church as such, being no
true church of Christ's institution, (of which by itself
anon,) it followeth that a papist as a papist is no
member of the church of Christ, that is, no christian.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_228" id="Ref_228" href="#Foot_228">[228]</a></span>
But yet, whether the same person may not
be a papist and a christian, and so a member of the
catholic church, we shall anon inquire.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXVI. There are many things which
make up the fitness and desirableness of that particular
church, which we should prefer or choose for
our ordinary personal communion:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_229" id="Ref_229" href="#Foot_229">[229]</a></span>
as, 1. That it
be the church of that place where we dwell; if the
place be so happy as to have no divided churches,
that it be the sole church there; however, that it be
so near as to be fit for our communion. 2. That it
be a church which holdeth communion with other
neighbour churches, and is not singular or divided
from them; or at least not from the generality
of the churches of Christ; nor differeth in any great
matters from those that are most pure. 3. That
it be under the reputation of soundness with the
other churches aforesaid, and not under the scandal
of heresy, schism, or gross corruption among
those that live about.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_230" id="Ref_230" href="#Foot_230">[230]</a></span>
4. That it be under the
countenance and encouraging favour of the christian
magistrate. 5. That it be the same church of
which the rest of the family which we are of be
members; that husband and wife, parents and children,
masters and servants, be not of several churches.
6. That the pastors be able teachers, prudent guides,
and of holy lives, and diligent in their office. 7.
That the pastors be regularly called to their office.
8. That the members be intelligent, peaceable, and
of holy, temperate, and righteous lives. But when
all these cannot be had together, we must choose
that church which hath those qualifications which
are most needful, and bear with tolerable imperfections.
The most needful are the first, second, and
sixth of these qualifications.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXVII. He that is free, should choose that
church which is the fittest for his own edification;
that is, the best pastors, people, and administrations.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXVIII. A man's freedom is many ways
restrained herein. As, 1. When it will tend to a
greater public hurt, by disorder, ill example, division,
discouragement, &amp;c. 2. When superiors forbid
it; as husbands, parents, masters, magistrates.
3. By some scandal. 4. By the distance or inconvenience
of our dwelling. 5. By differences of judgment,
and other causes of contention in the said
churches; and many other ways.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_231" id="Ref_231" href="#Foot_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXIX. A free man who removeth from one
church to another for his edification, is not therefore
a separatist or schismatic; but it must not be done
by one that is not free, but upon such necessity as
freeth him.</p>

<p><i>Prop.</i> XXX. It is schism or sinful separation to
separate from, 1. A true church as no true church.
2. From lawful worship and communion, as lawful;
but of this more in its proper place.</p>

<h3>Quest. II. <i>Whether we must esteem the church of Rome a true church?
And in what sense some divines affirm it, and some deny it.</i></h3>

<p>Want of some easy distinguishing hath made that
seem a controversy here, which is so plain, that it
can hardly be any at all to protestants, if the question
had been but truly stated.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_232" id="Ref_232" href="#Foot_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>Remember therefore that by a church is meant,
not a mere company of christians, any how related
to each other; but a society consisting of an ecclesiastical
head and body, such as we call a political
society. 2. And that we speak not of an accidental
head (such as the king is, because he governeth
them <i>suo modo</i> by the sword); for that is not an essential
constitutive part; but of a constitutive ecclesiastical
head and body. 3. That the question is
not, Whether the church of Rome be a part of the
church, but whether it be a true church? And now
I answer,</p>

<p>1. To affirm the church of Rome to be the catholic
or universal church, is more than to affirm it to
be a true catholic church, that is, a true part of the
catholic church: and is as much as to say that it is
the whole and only church, and that there is no
other; which is odious falsehood and usurpation,
and slander against all other churches.</p>

<p>2. The church of Rome is so called in the question,
as it is a policy or church in a general sense;
and the meaning of the question is, Whether it be
a divine, or a human or diabolical policy; a lawful
church.</p>

<p>3. The church of Rome is considered, 1. Formally,
as a church or policy. 2. Materially, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">{629}</a></span>
singular persons are qualified. It is the form that
denominateth. Therefore the question must be taken
of the Roman policy, or of the church of Rome as
such; that is, as it is one ruler pretending to be the
vicarious, constitutive, governing head of all Christ's
visible church on earth, and the body which owneth
him in this relation.</p>

<p>4. Therefore I conclude (and so do all protestants)
that this policy or church of Rome is no true church
of Christ's instituting or approbation, but a human,
sinful policy, formed by the temptation of Satan, the
prince of pride, deceit, and darkness. The proof of
which is the matter of whole loads of protestant
writings. And indeed the proof of their policy being
incumbent on themselves, they fail in it, and are still
fain to fly to pretended, false tradition for proof, in
which the sophisters know that either they must be
judges themselves, and it must go for truth because
they say it; or else that if they can carry the controversy
into a thicket or wood of fathers and church
history, at least they can confound the ignorant, and
evade themselves. Of this see my "Disput. with
Johnson," and my "Key for Catholics," &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. The bishop of the English papists, Smith called
bishop of Chalcedon, in his Survey, c. v. saith,
"To us it sufficeth that the bishop of Rome is St.
Peter's successor; and this all the fathers testify,
and all the catholic church believeth; but whether
it be <i>jure divino</i> or <i>humano</i>, is no point of faith."
The like hath Davenport,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_233" id="Ref_233" href="#Foot_233">[233]</a></span>
called Fransc. a Sancta
Clara more largely. By this let the reader judge
whether we need more words to prove their church
to be such as Christ never instituted, when the belief
of their divine right is no part of their own
faith.</p>

<p>6. If the church of Rome in its formal policy be
but of human institution, it is, 1. Unnecessary to salvation.
2. Unlawful; because they that first instituted
it had no authority so to do, and were usurpers.
For either the makers of it were themselves a church
or no church. If no church, they could not lawfully
make a church. Infidels or heathens are not to be
our church makers. If a church, then there was a
church before the church of Rome, and that of
another form. And if that former form were of
Christ's institution, man might not change it; if not,
who made that form? and so on.</p>

<p>7. Our divines therefore that say that the church
of Rome is a true church, though corrupt, do not
speak of it formally as to the papal policy or headship,
but materially. 1. That all papists that are
visible christians are visible parts of the universal
church. 2. That their particular congregations
considered abstractedly from the Roman headship
may be true particular churches, though corrupt;
which yet being the only difficulty shall be the matter
of our next inquiry.</p>

<h3>Quest. III. <i>Whether we must take the Romish clergy for true
ministers of Christ? And whether their baptism and ordination be
nullities?</i></h3>

<p>I join these two distinct questions together for
brevity.</p>

<p>I. As true signifieth regularly called, so they are
commonly irregular and not true ministers. But as
true signifieth real opposed to a nullity, so it is now
to be further considered.</p>

<p>The doubt lieth either of the sufficiency of his
call, or of somewhat that is supposed to destroy it
by contradiction or redundancy. 1. Whether he
want any thing of absolute necessity to the office,
who is called in the church of Rome? or, 2. Whether
there be any thing in his office or entrance, which
nullifieth or invalidateth that which else would be
sufficient?</p>

<p>For the first doubt, it is not agreed on among
papists or protestants what is of necessity to the
being of the office. Some think real godliness in
the person is necessary; but most think not. Some
think that visible, that is, seeming professed godliness,
not disproved by mortal sin, is necessary; and
some think not. Some think the people's election is
necessary, and that ordination is but <i>ad bene esse</i>;
and some think ordination necessary <i>ad esse</i>, and
election <i>ad bene esse</i>, or not at all; and some think
both necessary <i>ad esse</i>, and some neither. Some
think the election of the people is necessary, and
some think only their consent is necessary, though
after election by others; some think it must be the
consent of all the flock, or near all; and some only
of the major part; and some of the better part,
though the minor. Some think the ordination of a
diocesan bishop necessary <i>ad esse</i>, and some not.
Some think the truth of the ordainers' calling, or
power, to be necessary to the validity of his ordination,
and some not. Some think the number of two,
or three, or more ordainers to be necessary, and
some not. Some think it necessary to the validity of
the ministry that it come down from the apostles by
an uninterrupted succession of truly ordained bishops,
and some think not. Some few think that the magistrates'
command or licence is necessary, and only it,
and most deny both. Johnson, alias Terret, the
papist, in his Disputation against me, maintaineth
that consecration is not necessary <i>ad esse</i>, nor any
one way of election, by these or those, but only the
church's reception upon such an election as may give
them notice, and which may be different, according
to different times, places, and other circumstances.</p>

<p>In the midst of these confusions, what is to be
held? I have opened the case as fully and plainly as
I can, in my second "Disput. of Church Government,"
about ordination, to which I must refer the
reader: only here briefly touching upon the sum.</p>

<p>1. There are some personal qualifications necessary
to the being of the office, (of which anon,) and
some only to the well-being.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_234" id="Ref_234" href="#Foot_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The efficient conveying cause of power or
office, is God's will signified in his own established
law; in which he determineth that such persons so
called shall receive from him such power, and be
obliged to such office administrations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_235" id="Ref_235" href="#Foot_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Any providence of God which infallibly or
satisfactorily notifieth to the church, who these persons
are, that receive such power from God, doth
oblige them to submit to them as so empowered.</p>

<p>4. God's ordinary established way of regular designation
of the person, is by the church's consent,
and the senior pastor's ordination.</p>

<p>5. By these actions they are not the proper donors
or efficients of the power, or office given, but the
consent of the people and the ordination do determine
of the recipient, and so are regularly <i>causa sine
qua non</i> of his reception. And the ordination is
moreover a solemn investiture in the office, as when
a servant is sent by delivering a key to deliver possession
of a house, by his master's consent, to him
that had before the owner's grant; and so it ceremoniously
entereth him into visible possession; like
the solemnizing of marriage, or the listing of a
soldier, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. The people's consent (before or after) is not
only by institution, but naturally necessary, that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">{630}</a></span>
man become a pastor to those persons (for no man
can learn, obey, &amp;c. without consent): but it is not
of necessity to the being of the ministry in general,
or in the first instant: a man without it may be
authorized as a minister to go preach the gospel for
conversion, and baptize and gather churches, though
not to be their stated pastor.</p>

<p>7. When death, distance, corruption, heresy, or
malignity of pastors within reach, maketh it impossible
to have ordination, God's choice of the person
may be notified without it: as by, 1. Eminent qualifications.
2. The people's real necessities. 3. And
the removal of impediments, and a concurrence of
inviting opportunities and advantages. 4. And sometimes
the people's desire. 5. And sometimes the
magistrate's commission or consent; which though
not absolutely necessary in themselves, yet may
serve to design the person and invest him, when the
ordinary way faileth; which is all that is left to man
to do, to the conveyance of the power.</p>

<p>The case being thus stated, as to what is necessary
to give the power or office, we may next inquire
whether any papist priest have such power, by such
means.</p>

<p>And, 1. We have sufficient reason to judge that
many of them have all the personal qualifications
which are essentially necessary. 2. Many among
them have the consent of a sober christian people
(of which more anon). And Mr. Jacob, who was
against bishops and their ordination, proveth at large,
that by election or consent of the people alone, a
man may be a true pastor, either without such ordination,
or notwithstanding both the vanity and error
of it. 3. Many of them have ordination by able
and sober bishops; if that also be necessary. 4. In
that ordination, they are invested in all that is essential
to the pastoral office.</p>

<p>So that I see not that their calling is a nullity
through defect of any thing of absolute necessity to
its being and validity; though it be many ways irregular
and sinful.</p>

<p>II. We are next therefore to inquire whether any
contradicting additions make null that which else
would be no nullity. And this is the great difficulty.
For as we accuse not their religion for having too
little, but too much, so this is our chief doubt about
their ministry.</p>

<p>And, 1. It is doubted, as to the office itself, whether
a mass priest be a true minister, as having another
work to do, even to make his Maker, and to give
Christ's real flesh with his hands to the people; and
to preach the unsound doctrines of their church; and
these seem to be essential parts of his function.</p>

<p>The case is very bad and sad; but that which I
said about the heresies or errors which may consist
with christianity, when they overthrow it but by an
undiscerned consequence, must be here also considered.
The prime part of their office is that (as
to the essentials) which Christ ordained: this they
receive, and to this they sew a filthy rag of man's
devising; but if they knew this to be inconsistent
with christianity or the essentials of the ministry,
we may well presume (of many of them) they would
not receive it. Therefore as an error which consequentially
contradicteth some essential article of
faith, nullifieth not his christianity who first and
fastest holdeth the faith, and would cast away the
error if he saw the contradiction, (as Davenant,
Morton, and Hall have showed, Epist. Conciliat.)
so is it to be said as to practical error in the present
case. They are their grievous errors and sins, but,
for aught I see, do not nullify their office to the
church. As a mass priest, he is no minister of
Christ (as an anabaptist is not as a re-baptizer, nor
a separatist as a separater, nor an antinomian, or
any erroneous person, as a preacher of that error);
but as a christian pastor ordained to preach the
gospel, baptize, administer the Lord's supper, pray,
praise God, guide the church, he may be.</p>

<p>The same answer serveth to the objection as it
extendeth to the erroneous doctrines which they
preach, which are but by consequence against the
essentials of religion.</p>

<p>2. But it is a greater doubt, Whether any power
of the ministry can be conveyed by antichrist, or
from him? and whether God will own any of antichrist's
administrations? Therefore seeing they profess
themselves to have no office but what they receive
from the pope, and Christ disowning his usurpation,
the same man cannot be the minister of Christ
and antichrist; as the same man cannot be an officer
in the king's army and his enemies'.</p>

<p>But this will have the same solution as the former.
If this antichrist were the open, professed enemy to
Christ, then all this were true: because their corrupt
additions would not by dark consequences, but
so directly contain the denial of christianity or the
true ministry, that it were not possible to hold both.
But (as our divines commonly note) antichrist is to
sit in the temple of God, and the pope's treason is
under pretence of the greatest service and friendship
to Christ, making himself his vicar-general without
his commission. So they that receive power
from him, do think him to be Christ's vicar indeed,
and so renounce not Christ, but profess their first
and chief relation to be to him, and dependence on
him, and that they would have nothing to do with
the pope, if they knew him to be against Christ.
And some of them write, that the power or office is
immediately from Christ, and that the pope, ordainers,
and electors do but design the person that shall
receive it (because else they know not what to say
of the election and consecration of the pope himself,
who hath no superior). And the Spanish bishops
in the council of Trent held so close to this, that the
rest were fain to leave it undetermined; so that it is
no part of their religion, but a doubtful opinion,
Whether the power of bishops be derived from the
pope, though they be governed by him?</p>

<p>But as to the other, the case seemeth like this: if
a subject in Ireland usurp the lieutenancy, and tell
all the people that he hath the king's commission
to be his lieutenant, and command all to submit to
him, and receive their places from him, and obey
him; and the king declareth him a traitor, (antecedently
only by the description of his laws,) and
maketh it the duty of the subjects to renounce him;
those now that know the king's will, and yet adhere
to the usurper, though they know that the king is
against it, are traitors with him: but those from
whom he keepeth the knowledge of the laws, and
who for want of full information believe him to be
really the king's lieutenant, (and specially living
where all believe it,) but yet would renounce him if
they knew that he had not the king's commission;
these are the king's subjects, though in ignorance
they obey a usurper. And on this account it is
that Archbishop Usher concluded, that an ignorant
papist might be saved, but the learned hardly. But
when the learned, through the disadvantages of their
education, are under the same ignorance, being
learned but on one side but to their greater seduction,
the case may be the same.</p>

<p>The same man therefore may receive an office
from Christ, who yet ignorantly submitteth to the
pope, and receiveth corrupt additions from him.</p>

<p>But suppose I be mistaken in all this, yet to come
to the second question,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">{631}</a></span>
III. Whether baptism and ordination given by
them be nullities? I answer, no; on a further account,
1. Because that the ministry which is a nullity
to the receiver, (that is, God will punish him as a
usurper,) may yet perform those ministerial acts
which are no nullities to the church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_236" id="Ref_236" href="#Foot_236">[236]</a></span>
Else how
confused a case would all churches be in! For it is
hard ever to know whether ministers have all things
essential to their office. Suppose a man be ignorant,
or a heretic against some essential article of faith;
or suppose that he feigned orders of ordination when
he had none; or that he was ordained by such as
really had no power to do it; or suppose he pretended
the consent of the majority of the people,
when really the greater part were for another: if all
this be unknown, his baptizing and other administrations
are not thereby made nullities to the church,
though they be sins in him. The reason is, because
that the church shall not suffer, nor lose her right
for another man's sin! When the fault is not theirs,
the loss and punishment shall not be theirs. He
that is found in possession of the place, performeth
valid administration to them that know not his
usurpation, and are not guilty of it. Otherwise we
should never have done re-baptizing, nor know
easily when we receive any valid administrations,
while we are so disagreed about the necessaries of
the office and call; and when it is so hard in all
things to judge of the call of all other men.</p>

<p>2. And as the papists say, that a private man or
woman may baptize in extremity, so many learned
protestants think, that though a private man's baptism
be a sin, yet it is no nullity, though he were
known to be no minister.</p>

<p>And what is said of baptism, to avoid tediousness,
you may suppose said of ordination, which will carry
the first case far, as to the validity of the ministry
received by papists' ordination, as well as of baptism
and visible christianity received by them. For my
part, God used Parson's "Book of Resolution corrected,"
so much to my good, and I have known so many
eminent christians, and some ministers, converted by
it, that I am glad that I hear none make a controversy
of it, whether the conversion, faith, or love to
God be valid, which we receive by the books or
means of any papist?</p>

<h3>Quest. IV. <i>Whether it be necessary to believe that the pope is the
antichrist?</i></h3>

<p>It is one question, whether he be antichrist? and
another, whether it be necessary to believe it? To
the first I say, 1. There are many antichrists: and
we must remove the ambiguity of the name, before
we can resolve the question. If by antichrist be
meant, one that usurps the office of a universal vicar
of Christ, and constituting and governing head of
the whole visible church, and hereby layeth the
ground of schisms, and contentions, and bloodshed
in the world, and would rob Christ of all his members,
who are not of the pope's kingdom, and that
formeth a multifarious ministry for this service, and
corrupteth much of the doctrine, worship, and discipline
of the church, in this sense no doubt but the
pope is antichrist.</p>

<p>But if by antichrist be meant him particularly described
in the Apocalypse and Thessalonians, then
the controversy <i>de re</i>, is about the exposition of those
dark prophecies. Of which I can say no more but
this, 1. That if the pope be not he, he had ill luck to
be so like him. 2. That Dr. More's moral arguments,
and Bishop Downham's and many others'
expository arguments, are such as I cannot answer.
3. But yet my skill is not so great in interpreting
those obscure prophecies, as that I can say, I am
sure that it is the pope that they speak of, and that
Lyra, learned Zanchy, and others that think it is
Mahomet, or others that otherwise interpret them,
were mistaken.</p>

<p>II. But to the second question, I more boldly say,
1. That every one that indeed knoweth this to be the
sense of those texts, is bound to believe it.</p>

<p>2. But that God, who hath not made it of necessity
to salvation to understand many hundred plainer
texts, nor absolutely to understand more than the
articles and fundamentals of our religion, hath much
less made it necessary to salvation to understand the
darkest prophecies.</p>

<p>3. And that as the suspicion should make all christians
cautelous what they receive from Rome, so the
obscurity should make all christians take heed, that
they draw from it no consequences destructive to
love, or order, or any truth, or christian duty. And
this is the advice I give to all.</p>

<h3>Quest. V. <i>Whether we must hold that a papist may be saved?</i></h3>

<p>This question may be resolved easily from what
is said before.</p>

<p>1. A papist as a papist, that is, by popery, will
never be saved, no more than a man's life by a leprosy.</p>

<p>2. If a papist be saved, he must be saved against,
and from popery, either by turning from the opinion,
and then he is no papist, or by preserving his heart
from the power of his own opinions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_237" id="Ref_237" href="#Foot_237">[237]</a></span>
And the same
we may say of every error and sin. He that is
saved, must be saved from it, at least from the power
of it on the heart, and from the guilt of it by forgiveness.</p>

<p>3. Every one that is a true, sincere christian in
faith, love, and true obedience, shall be saved, what
error soever he hold that doth consist with these.</p>

<p>4. As many antinomians and other erroneous persons,
do hold things which by consequence subvert
christianity; and yet not seeing the inconsistence, do
hold christianity first and faster, in heart and sincere
practice, and would renounce their error if they saw
the inconsistence, so is it with many papists. And
that which they hold first, and fastest, and practically,
doth save them from the power, operations,
and poison of their own opinions: as an antidote or
the strength of nature may save a man from a small
quantity of poison.</p>

<p>5. Moreover we have cause to judge that there
are millions among the papists, corrupted with many
of their lesser errors, who yet hold not their greater;
that believe not that none are christians but the
pope's subjects, and that Christ's kingdom and the
pope's are of the same extent, or that he can remit
men's pains in another world, or that the bread and
wine are no bread and wine, or that men merit of
God in point of commutative justice, or that we must
adore or worship the bread, or yet the cross or image
itself, &amp;c. or that consent to abundance of the clergy's
tyrannical usurpations and abuses: and so being not
properly papists, may be saved, if a papist might
not. And we the less know how many or few
among them are really of the clergy's religion and
mind, because by terror they restrain men from
manifesting their judgment, and compel them to
comply in outward things.</p>

<p>6. But as fewer that have leprosies, or plagues, or
that take poison, escape, than of other men, so we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">{632}</a></span>
have great cause to believe, that much fewer papists
are saved, than such as escape their errors. And
therefore all that love their souls should avoid them.</p>

<p>7. And the trick of the papists who persuade people
that theirs is the safest religion, because we say
that a papist may be saved, and they say that a protestant
cannot, is so palpable a cheat, that it should
rather deter men from their way. For God is love;
and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God; and
all men must know us to be Christ's disciples, by
loving one another; and he that saith he loveth
God, and loveth not his brother, is a liar; and
charity believeth all things credible. That religion
is likest to be of God which is most charitable, and
not that which is most uncharitable, and malicious,
and like to Satan.</p>

<p>To conclude, no man shall be saved for being no
papist, much less for being a papist. And all that
are truly holy, heavenly, humble lovers of God, and
of those that are his servants, shall be saved. But
how many such are among the papists, God only
knoweth who is their Judge.</p>

<p class="thtbrk">The questions whether the Greeks, Abassines,
Nestorians, Eutychians, antinomians, anabaptists,
&amp;c. may be saved, must be all resolved as this of the
papists, allowing for the different degrees of their
corruption. And therefore I must desire the reader
to take up with this answer for all, and excuse me
from unnecessary repetition.</p>

<p>As for such disputers as my antagonist Mr. Johnson,
who insisteth on that of Tit. iii. 10, "A man that
is an heretic&mdash;is condemned of himself;" when he
hath proved that the word heretic hath but one signification,
I will say as he doth. Till then, if he
will try who shall be damned by bare equivocal
words, without the definition, let him take his course,
for I will be none of his imitators.</p>

<h3>Quest. VI. <i>Whether those that are in the church of Rome, are bound
to separate from it? And whether it be lawful to go to their mass or
other worship?</i></h3>

<p>These two also for brevity I join together.</p>

<p>I. To the first, we must distinguish of separation:
1. It is one thing to judge that evil which is evil,
and separate from it in judgment. 2. It is another
thing to express this by forbearing to subscribe,
swear, or otherwise approve that evil. 3. And
another thing to forbear communion with them in
the mass and image worship, and gross or known
sins. 4. And another thing to forbear all communion
with them, even as to baptism and other lawful
things. 5. And another thing to use some open
detestations or protestations against them.</p>

<p>2. And we must distinguish much of persons,
whether they be ministers or people, free or bound,
as wives, children, &amp;c. And now I answer,</p>

<p>1. There is no question but it is a duty to judge
all that evil which is evil among the papists or any
other.</p>

<p>2. It is the duty of all to forbear subscribing,
swearing to, or otherwise approving evil.</p>

<p>3. It is the duty of all mass priests to renounce
that part of their calling, and not to administer their
mass, or any other unlawful thing.</p>

<p>4. It is the duty of all private christians to forbear
communion in the mass, because it is a kind of idolatry,
while they worship apiece of bread as God; as
also image worship, and all other parts of their religion,
in which they are put upon sin themselves, or
that which is notorious scandal and symbolizing
with them in their bread worship, or rather corruptions
of the substance of God's ordinances.</p>

<p>5. It is their duty who have fit opportunity, (when
it is like to do more good than harm,) to protest
against the papal corruptions where they are, and to
declare their detestation of them.</p>

<p>6. It is the duty of those that have children to be
baptized or catechised, to make use of more lawful
and sound ministers, when they may be had, rather
than of a papist priest.</p>

<p>7. But in case they cannot remove, or enjoy better,
I think it is lawful, 1. To let such baptize their
children, rather than leave them unbaptized. 2. To
let their children be taught by them to read, or in
arts and sciences, or the catechism, and common principles
of religion, so they will mix no dangerous
errors. 3. And to hear those of them preach, who
preach soundly and piously (such as were Gerrhard,
Zutphaniensis, Thaulerus, Ferus, and many more).
4. And to read such good books as these now mentioned
have written. 5. And to join with them in
such prayers as are sound and pious, so they go no
further.</p>

<p>8. And wives, children, and such other as are
bound, and cannot lawfully remove, may stay among
them, and take up with these helps, dealing faithfully
in abstaining from the rest.</p>

<p>II. The second question is answered in this. Only
I add, that it is one thing to be present as Elias was,
in a way of opposition to them; or as disputants
are, that open their errors; or as a wise man may
go to hear or see what they do, without compliance,
as we read their books; and it is another thing to
join with them in their sinful worship, or scandalously
to encourage them in it by seeming so to do.

<h3>Quest. VII. <i>Whether the true calling of the minister by ordination
or election, &amp;c. be necessary to the essence of the church?</i></h3>

<p>By a church here we mean a political society of
christians, and not any assembly or community. And
no doubt pastor and flock are the constitutive parts
of such a church; and where either of them are notoriously
wanting, it is notorious that there is no true
church. Therefore all the doubt is, whether such
parts of his call be necessary to the being of the
ministry, or not? And here we must conclude, that
the word ministry and church are ambiguous. By
a minister or pastor is meant, either one that God so
far owneth as to accept and justify his administrations
as for himself, even his own good and salvation;
or one whose administrations God will own,
accept, and bless to the people.</p>

<p>I. In the former sense, 1. He is no true minister
that wanteth the essential qualifications of a minister,
viz. that hath not, (1.) The understanding and belief
of all the essential articles of faith, without heresy.
(2.) Tolerable ability to teach these to the people, and
perform the other essentials of his office. (3.) Sincere
godliness, to do all this in love and obedience to
God as his servant, in order to life eternal. 2. And
he is thus no true pastor as to God's acceptance of
himself, who hath not a lawful calling; that is,
(1.) Ordination, when it may be had. (2.) The
consent or reception of that church of which he pretendeth
to be pastor, which is still necessary, and
must be had, if ordination cannot.</p>

<p>II. But in the second sense, he is a pastor so far
as that God will own his administrations as to the
people's good, who, 1. Hath possession. 2. And
seemeth to them to have necessary qualifications,
and a lawful call, though it prove otherwise, so be
it, it be not through their wilful fault, that he is culpable,
or they mistaken in him. If he be not a true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">{633}</a></span>
believer, but an infidel, or heretic, he is no minister
as to himself, that is, God will use him as a usurper
that hath no title:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_238" id="Ref_238" href="#Foot_238">[238]</a></span>
but if he profess to be a believer
when he is not, he is a true pastor visibly to
the people; otherwise they could never know when
they have a pastor: even as real faith makes a real
christian, and professed faith makes a visible christian,
so is it as to the ministry. If he seem to
understand the articles of faith, and do not, or if
he seem to have due ordination when he hath not,
if he be upon this mistake accepted by the people,
he is a true visible pastor as to them, that is, as
to their duty and benefit, though not as to himself.
Yea, the people's consent to his entrance
is not necessary <i>ad esse</i>, nor to his relation neither,
so far as to justify himself, but to his administrations
and to his relation, so far as their own right and
benefit are interested in it. So that two things are
necessary to such a visible pastor as shall perform
valid administrations to the church: 1. Seeming
necessary qualifications and calling to it. 2. Possession,
by the people's reception or consent to his
administrations and relation so far as to their benefit.</p>

<p>And, III. Thus also we must distinguish of the
word church. It is, 1. Such an entire christian
society as hath a minister or pastor whose office is
valid as to himself and them; or it is such a society
only as hath a pastor whose office is valid to them
but not to himself. Let us not confound the question
<i>de re</i> and <i>de nomine</i>. These societies differ as
is said. Both may fitly be called true churches.</p>

<p>As it is with a kingdom which hath a rightful
prince, and one that hath a usurper, so it is here.
1. If it have a rightful king accepted, it is a kingdom
in the fullest sense. 2. If it have a usurper accepted
as king, it is a kingdom, but faulty. 3. If the usurper
be only so far accepted as that the people consent
not to his entrance, no, nor his relation so as to
justify his title, but wish him cast out if they could
procure it; but yet consent to receive that protection
and justice which is their own due from the
possessor, and consent to his relation only thus far,
this is a kingdom truly, but more defective or maimed
than the first. 4. But if the people do not so
much as receive him, nor submit to his administrations,
he is but a conqueror, and not a king, and it is (in
respect to him) no kingdom (though in respect to
some other that hath title and consent, without
actual possession of the administration, it may be a
kingdom). And this is the true and plain solution of
this question, which want of distinction doth obscure.</p>

<h3>Quest. VIII. <i>Whether sincere faith and godliness be necessary to
the being of the ministry? And whether it be lawful to hear a wicked
man, or take the sacrament from him, or take him for a minister?</i></h3>

<p>This question receiveth the very same solution
with the last foregoing, and therefore I need not say
much more to it.</p>

<p>I. The first part is too oft resolved mistakingly on
both extremes. Some absolutely saying that godliness
or faith is not necessary to the being of the
ministry; and some that it is necessary. Whereas
the true solution is as aforesaid; sincere faith and
godliness are necessary to make a man a minister so
far as that God will own and justify him as sent by
himself, as to his own duty and benefit: for he cannot
be internally and heartily a christian pastor that
is no christian, nor a minister of God who is not
godly, that is, is not truly resigned to God, obeyeth
him not and loveth him not as God. But yet the
reality of these are not necessary to make him a
visible pastor, as to the people's duty and benefit.</p>

<p>2. But the profession of true faith and godliness is
necessary so far, as that without it the people ought
not to take him for a visible minister (as the profession
of christianity is to a visible christian).</p>

<p>3. And in their choice they ought to prefer him
<i>cæteris paribus</i>, whose profession is most credible.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> That which maketh a minister is gifts and
a calling, which are distinct from grace and real
christianity. <i>Answ.</i> Every minister is a christian,
though every christian be not a minister or pastor:
therefore he that is a visible pastor must visibly or
in profession have both.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But a man may be a christian, without
saving grace or godliness. <i>Answ.</i> As much as he
may be godly without godliness. That is, he may
be visibly a christian and godly, without sincere
faith or godliness, but not without the profession
of both. It is not possible that the profession of
christianity in the essentials, can be without the profession
of godliness; for it includeth it.</p>

<p>II. To the other question I answer, 1. A man that
professeth infidelity or impiety, yea, that professeth
not faith and godliness, is not to be taken for a
minister, or heard as such.</p>

<p>2. Every one that professeth to stand to his baptismal
covenant professeth faith and godliness.</p>

<p>3. He that by a vicious life or bad application of
doctrine contradicteth his profession, is to be lawfully
accused of it, and heard speak for himself, and to be
cast out by true church justice, and not by the private
censure of a private person.</p>

<p>4. Till this be done, though a particular private
member of the church be not bound to think that
the minister is worthy, nor that the church which
suffereth and receiveth him doth well, yet they are
bound to judge him one who by the church's reception
is in possession, and therefore a visible pastor,
and to submit to his public administrations; because
it is not in a private man's power, but the church's,
to determine who shall be the pastor.</p>

<p>5. But if the case be past controversy and notorious,
that the man is not only scandalous, and weak,
and dull, and negligent, but also either, 1. Intolerably
unable; 2. Or an infidel, or gross heretic; 3. Or
certainly ungodly; a private man should admonish
the church and him, and in case that they proceed
in impenitency, should remove himself to a better
church and ministry. And the church itself should
disown such a man, and commit their souls to one
that is fitter for the trust.</p>

<p>6. And that church or person who needlessly
owneth such a pastor, or preferreth him before a
fitter, doth thereby harden him in his usurpation,
and is guilty of the hurt of the people's souls, and of
his own, and of the dishonour done to God.</p>

<h3>Quest. IX. <i>Whether the people are bound to receive or consent to an
ungodly, intolerable, heretical pastor, yea, or one far less fit and
worthy than a competitor, if the magistrate command it, or the bishop
impose him?</i></h3>

<p>For the deciding of this, take these propositions.</p>

<p>1. The magistrate is authorized by God to govern
ministers and churches, according to the orders and
laws of Christ (and not against them); but not to
ordain or degrade, nor to make ministers or unmake
them, nor to deprive the church of the liberty settled
on it by the laws of Christ.</p>

<p>2. The bishops or ordainers are authorized by
Christ to judge of the fitness of the person to the
office in general, and solemnly to invest him in it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">{634}</a></span>
but not to deprive the people of their freedom, and
exercise of the natural care of their own salvation,
or of any liberty given them by Christ.</p>

<p>3. The people's liberty in choosing or consenting
to their own pastors, to whom they must commit the
care of their souls, is partly founded in nature, (it
being they that must have the benefit or loss, and no
man being authorized to damn or hazard men's
souls, at least against their wills,) and partly settled
by Scripture, and continued in the church above a
thousand years after Christ, at least in very many
parts of it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_239" id="Ref_239" href="#Foot_239">[239]</a></span>
See Blondel's "Full Proof de jure
plebis in regim. Eccles." Hildebertus Cænoman.
(alias Turonensis) even in his time showeth, that
though the clergy were to lead, and the people to
follow, yet no man was to be made a bishop, or put
upon the people, without their own consent: Epist.
12. Bibl. Pet. to. iii. p. 179. Filesacus will direct
you to more such testimonies. But the thing is past
controversy. I need not cite to the learned the commonly
cited testimony of Cyprian, <i>Plebs maximam
habet potestatem indignos recusandi, &amp;c.</i> And indeed
in the nature of the thing it cannot be: for though
you may drench a mad-man's body by force, when
you give him physic, you cannot so drench men's
souls, nor cure them against their wills.</p>

<p>4. Not that the people's consent is necessary to
the general office of a gospel minister, to preach and
baptize; but only to the appropriation or relation of
a minister to themselves; that is, to the being of a
pastor of a particular church as such, but not of a
minister of Christ as such.</p>

<p>5. A man's soul is of so great value above all the
favour of man, or treasures of this world, that no
man should be indifferent to what man's care he
doth commit it; nor should he hazard it upon the
danger of everlasting misery, for fear of displeasing
man, or being accused of schism or disorder.</p>

<p>6. There is as great difference between an able,
learned, judicious, orthodox, godly, diligent, lively
teacher, and an ignorant, heretical, ungodly, dull,
and slothful man, as there is between a skilful and
an ignorant pilot at sea; or between an able, experienced,
faithful physician, and an ignorant, rash,
and treacherous one, as to the saving men's lives.
And he that would not take a sot or an empiric for his
physician, who were like to kill him, and refuse the
counsel of an able physician, in obedience to a magistrate
or bishop, hath as little reason to do the like
by his soul; nor should he set less by that than by
his life.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_240" id="Ref_240" href="#Foot_240">[240]</a></span>
And if Paul said, We have this power for
edification and not for destruction, we may say so of
all magistrates and bishops. Sober divines have
lately showed their error who teach men that they
must be ready to submit to damnation if God require
it, or to suppose that his glory and our salvation are
separable ends; because damnation is a thing which
nature necessitateth man not to desire or intend!
And shall we ascribe more to a magistrate than to
God? and say that we must cast our souls on a likelihood
of damnation to keep order and in obedience to
man? No man can be saved without knowledge and
holiness: an ignorant, dead, ungodly minister is far
less likely to help us to knowledge and holiness,
than an able, holy man. To say God can work by
the unfittest instrument is nothing to the purpose;
till you prove that God would have us take him for
his instrument, and that he useth equally to work by
such, as well as by the fit and worthy, or that we expect
wonders from God, and that ordinarily without
tempting him! yea, when such a usurper of the
ministry is like to damn himself, as well as the
people.</p>

<p>And here to lenify the minds of Ithacian prelates
towards those that seek their own edification, in such
a case as this, or that refuse unworthy pastors of
their imposing, I will entreat them to censure those
near them no more sharply than they do the persons
in these following instances. Yea, if a separatist go
too far, use him no more uncharitably, than you
would do these men.</p>

<p>(1.) Gildas Brit. is called Sapiens, and our eldest
writer; and yet he calleth the multitude of the lewd
British clergy whom he reprehendeth in his "Acris
Correptio," traitors and no priests; and concludeth
seriously, that he that calleth them priests, is not
<i>eximius christianus</i>, any excellent christian. Yet
those few that were pious he excepteth and commendeth.
Shall he account them no priests, for
their sinfulness, and will you force others, not only to
call them priests, but to commit their souls to such
men's conduct? when Christ hath said, "If the
blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch?"
and Paul, "Take heed unto thyself and unto thy
doctrine; for in so doing, thou shalt both save thyself
and them that hear thee?"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_241" id="Ref_241" href="#Foot_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>The second is our second (and first English) historian,
Beda, and in him the famous Johannes Episc.
Hagulstadensis Eccles. who, as he reporteth, wrought
very great miracles, as Eccles. Hist. lib. v. cap.
2-5, is to be read. This man had one Herebaldus
in his clergy, after an abbot; who himself told
Beda as followeth:&mdash;That this Johannes Ep. cured
him miraculously of a perilous hurt, taken by disobedient
horsemanship; and when he recovered, he
asked him, whether he were sure that he was baptized?
who answered, That he knew it past doubt,
and named the presbyter that baptized him. The
bishop answered him, If thou wast baptized by that
priest, thou wast not rightly baptized: for I know
him, and that when he was ordained presbyter, he
was so dull of wit, that he could not learn the ministry
of catechising and baptizing. Wherefore I
commanded him altogether to give over the presumption
of this ministry, which he could not altogether
fulfil. And having thus said, he himself took
care to catechise me the same hour; and&mdash;being
cured&mdash;<i>vitali etiam unda perfusus sum</i>, I was baptized.</p>

<p>I commend not this example of re-baptizing, the
rather because it seems the priest was not deposed
till after he had baptized Herebaldus: but if he
went so far as to re-baptize, and account the baptism
a nullity, which was done by an unable, insufficient
presbyter, though rightly ordained, judge but
as favourably of men that avoid such presbyters in
our age.</p>

<p>The third instance shall be that of Cyprian, and
all the worthy bishops in the councils of Carthage
in his time, who re-baptized those baptized by heretics.
And consider withal that in those times many
were called heretics whom we call but schismatics,
that drew disciples after them into separated bodies
and parties, speaking perverse things, though not
contrary to the very essentials of religion, Acts xx.
30. I justify not their opinion: but if so many
holy bishops counted the very baptism of such a
nullity, be not too severe and censorious against those
that go not at all so far from an insufficient, or ungodly,
or grossly scandalous man, for the mere preservation
of their own souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">{635}</a></span>
To these I will add the saying of one of the honester
sort of Jesuits, Acosta; and in him of an ancienter
than he: lib. iv. c. 1. p. 354. de reb. Indic.
He extolleth the words of Dionysius Epist. viii. ad
Demoph. which are, <i>Si igitur quæ illuminat sacerdotum
est sancta distinctio, proculdubio ille a sacerdotali
ordine et virtute omnino prolapsus est, qui illuminans
non est, multoque sane magis qui neque illuminatus est.
Atque mihi quidem videtur audax nimium hujusmodi
est, si sacerdotalia munia sibi assumit; neque metuit,
neque veretur ea quæ sunt divina præter meritum persequi;
putatque ea latere Deum, quorum sibi ipse conscius
sit; et se Deum fallere existimat, quem falso nomine
appellat patrem; audetque scelestas blasphemias
suas (neque enim preces dixerim) sacris aris inferre;
easque super signa illa divina, ad Christi similitudinem
dicere. Non est iste sacerdos; non est; sed infestus,
atrox, dolosus, illusor sui, et lupus in dominicam gregem
ovina pelle armatus. His plura aut majora de evangelici
ministerii et culmine et præcipitio qui expectat,
cuique ad resipiscendum non ista sufficiunt, infatuatum
se juxta Domini sententiam, et nullo unquam sale saliri
posse demonstrat.</i> I will not English it, lest those
take encouragement by it who are bent to the other
extreme.</p>

<p>7. Yet it will be a great offence, if any censorious,
self-conceited person shall on this pretence set up
his judgment of men's parts, to the contempt of
authority, or to the vilifying of worthy men; and
especially if he thereby make a stir and schism in the
church, instead of seeking his own edification.</p>

<p>8. Yea, if a minister be weaker, yea, and colder
and worse than another, yet if his ministry be competently
fitted to edification, he that cannot leave him
and go to a better, without apparent hurt to the
church, and the souls of others, by division, or exasperating
rulers, or breaking family order, or violating
relative duties, must take himself to be at present
denied the greater helps that others have, and may
trust God in the use of those weaker means, to accept
and bless him; because he is in the station
where he hath set him. This case therefore must
be resolved by a prudent comparing of the good or
hurt which is like to follow, and of the accidents or
circumstances whence that must be discerned.</p>

<h3>Quest. X. <i>What if the magistrate command the people to receive one
pastor, and the bishops or ordainers another, which of them must be
obeyed?</i></h3>

<p>1. The magistrate, and not the bishop or people,
(unless under him,) hath the power and disposal of
the circumstantials or accidents of the church; I
mean of the temple, the pulpit, the tithes, &amp;c.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_242" id="Ref_242" href="#Foot_242">[242]</a></span>
And
he is to determine what ministers are fit either for
his own countenance or toleration, and what not.
In these therefore he is to be obeyed before the
bishops or others.</p>

<p>2. If a pope or prelate of a foreign church, or any
that hath no lawful jurisdiction or government over
the church that wanteth a pastor, shall command
them to receive one, their command is null, and to
be contemned.</p>

<p>3. Neither magistrate nor bishop, as is said, may
deny the church or people any liberty which God in
nature, or Christ in the gospel, hath settled on them,
as to the reception of their proper pastors.</p>

<p>4. No bishop, but only the magistrate, can compel
by the sword the obedience of his commands.</p>

<p>5. If one of them command the reception of a
worthy person, and the other of an intolerable one,
the former must prevail, because of obedience to
Christ, and care of our souls.</p>

<p>6. But if the persons be equal, or both fit, the
magistrate is to be obeyed, if he be peremptory in
his commands, and decide the case in order to the
peace or protection of the church; both because it
is a lawful thing, and because else he will permit no
other.</p>

<p>7. And the rather because the magistrate's power
is more past controversy, than, whether any bishop,
pastor, or synod, can any further than by counsel
and persuasion, oblige the people to receive a pastor.</p>

<h3>Quest. XI. <i>Whether an uninterrupted succession either of right
ordination or of conveyance by jurisdiction, be necessary to the being
of the ministry, or of a true church?</i></h3>

<p>The papists have hitherto insisted on the necessity
of successive right ordination; but Voetius <i>de
desperata Causa Papatus</i> hath in this so handled
them, and confuted Jansenius, as hath indeed showed
the desperateness of that cause: and they perceive
that the papacy itself cannot be upheld by that way;
and therefore Johnson, alias Terret, in his rejoinder
against me, now concludeth, that it is not for want
of a successive consecration that they condemn the
church of England, but for want of true jurisdiction,
because other bishops had title to the places whilst
they were put in; and that successive consecration
(which we take to include ordination) is not necessary
to the being of ministry or church. And it is
most certain to any man acquainted in church history,
that their popes have had a succession of
neither. Their way of election hath been frequently
changed, sometimes being by the people, sometimes
by the clergy, sometimes by the emperors, and lastly
by the cardinals alone. Ordination they have sometimes
wanted, and a layman been chosen; and oft
the ordination hath been by such as had no power
according to their own laws. And frequent intercisions
have been made, sometimes by many years'
vacancy, when they had no church (and so there
was none on earth, if the pope be the constitutive
head) for want of a pope: sometimes by long schisms,
when of two or three popes, no one could be known
to have more right than another, nor did they otherwise
carry it, than by power at last: sometimes by
the utter incapacity of the possessors, some being
laymen, some heretics and infidels, so judged by
councils at Rome, Constance, Basil; and Eugenius
the fourth continued after he was so censured, and
condemned, and deposed by the general council. I
have proved all this at large elsewhere.</p>

<p>And he that will not be cheated with a bare sound
of words, but will ask them, whether by a succession
of jurisdiction, they mean efficient, conveying jurisdiction
in the causers of his call, or received jurisdiction
in the office received, will find that they do
but hide their desperate cause in confusion and an
insignificant noise. For they maintain that none on
earth have an efficient jurisdiction in making popes.
For the former pope doth not make his successor;
and both electors, ordainers, and consecrators, yea,
and the people receiving, they hold to be subjects of
the pope when made, and therefore make him not
by jurisdiction giving him the power. Therefore
Johnson tells me, that Christ only, and not man,
doth give the power, and they must needs hold that
men have nothing to do but design the person recipient
by election and reception, and to invest him
ceremonially in the possession. So that no efficient
jurisdiction is here used at all by man. And
for received jurisdiction, 1. No one questioneth but
when that office is received which is essentially governing,
he that receiveth it receiveth a governing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">{636}</a></span>
power, or else he did not receive the office. If the
question be only, whether the office of a bishop be
an office of jurisdiction, or contain essentially a governing
power, they make no question of this themselves.
So that the noise of successive jurisdiction
is vanished into nothing. 2. And with them that
deny any jurisdiction to belong to presbyters, this
will be nothing as to their case, who have nothing
but orders to receive.</p>

<p>They have nothing of sense left them to say but
this, That though the efficient jurisdiction which
maketh popes be only in Christ, because no men are
their superiors, yet bishops and presbyters who have
superiors, cannot receive their power but by an efficient
power of man, which must come down by uninterrupted
succession.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. And so if ever the papal office have an
intercision, (as I have proved it hath had as to lawful
popes,) the whole catholic church is nullified;
and it is impossible to give it a new being, but by a
new pope.</p>

<p>But the best is, that by their doctrine indeed they
need not to plead for an uninterrupted succession
either of popes, bishops, or presbyters, but that they
think it a useful cheat to perplex all that are not
their subjects. For if the papacy were extinct a
hundred years, Christ is still alive; and seeing it is
no matter <i>ad esse</i> who be the electors or consecraters,
so it be but made known conveniently to the people,
and men only elect and receive the person, and
Christ only giveth the power, (by his stated law,)
what hindereth after the longest extinction or intercision,
but that somebody, or some sort of person,
may choose a pope again, and so Christ make him
pope? And thus the catholic church may die and
live again by a new creation, many times over.</p>

<p>And when the pope hath a resurrection after the
longest intercision, so may all the bishops and priests
in the world, because a new pope can make new
bishops, and new bishops can make new priests.
And where then is there any show of necessity of an
uninterrupted succession of any of them? All that
will follow is, that the particular churches die till a
resurrection; and so doth the whole church on earth
every time the pope dieth, till another be made, if
he be the constitutive head.</p>

<p>2. But as they say that Christ only efficiently
giveth the power to the pope, so say we to the
bishops or pastors of the church. For there is no
act of Christ's collation to be proved, but the Scripture
law or grant: and if that standing law give
power to the pope, when men have but designed the
person, the same law will do the same to bishops or
pastors; for it establisheth their office in the same
sort. Or rather in truth there is no word, that
giveth power to any such officer as a universal
head or pope, but the law for the pastoral office is
uncontrovertible.</p>

<p>And what the Spanish bishops at Trent thought
of the Divine right of the bishop's office, I need not
mention.</p>

<p>I shall therefore thus truly resolve the question.</p>

<p>1. In all ordinations and elections, man doth but
first choose the recipient person. 2. And ceremoniously
and ministerially invest him in the possession
when God hath given him the power; but the efficient
collation or grant of the power is done only by
Christ, by the instrumentality of his law or institution.
As when the king by a charter saith, Whoever
the city shall choose, shall be their mayor, and
have such and such power, and be invested in it by
the recorder or steward: here the person elected receiveth
all his power from the king by his charter,
(which is a standing efficient, conveying it to the
capable chosen person,) and not from the choosers
or recorder; only the last is as a servant to deliver
possession. So is it in this case.</p>

<p>2. The regular way of entrance appointed by
Christ to make a person capable, is the said election
and ordination. And for order sake where that
may be had, the unordained are not to be received
as pastors.</p>

<p>3. If any get possession, by false, pretended ordination
or mission, and be received by the church. I
have before told you that he is a pastor as to the
church's use and benefit, though not to his own.
And so the church is not extinct by every fraudulent
usurpation or mistake, and so not by want of a true
ordination or mission.</p>

<p>4. If the way of regular ordination fail, God may
otherwise (by the church's necessity, and the notorious
aptitude of the person) notify his will to the
church, what person they shall receive; (as if a
layman were cast on the Indian shore and converted
thousands, who could have no ordination;) and upon
the people's reception or consent, that man will be
a true pastor.</p>

<p>And seeing the papists in the conclusion (as Johnson
<i>ubi supra</i>) are fain to cast all their cause on the
church's reception of the pope, they cannot deny
reasonably but <i>ad esse</i> the church's reception may
serve also for another officer; and indeed much better
than for a pope. For, 1. The universal church
is so great, that no man can know when the greater
part receiveth him, and when not, except in some
notorious declarations. 2. And it is now known,
that the far greater part of the universal church
(the Greeks, Armenians, Abassines, Coptics, protestants,
&amp;c.) do not receive the Roman head. 3.
And when one part of Europe received one pope, and
another part another pope, for above forty years together,
who could tell which of the parties was to
be accounted the church? It was not then known,
and is not known yet to this day; and no papist can
prove it, who affirmeth it.</p>

<p>As a church, e.&nbsp;g. Constantinople, may be gathered,
or <i>oriri de novo</i> where there is none before, so
may it be restored where it is extinct. And possibly
a layman (as Frumentius and Edesius in the Indies)
may be the instrument of men's conversion.
And if so, they may by consent become their pastors,
when regular ordination cannot be had.</p>

<p>I have said more of this in my "Disputations of
Church Government," disp. ii. The truth is, the
pretence of a necessity of uninterrupted, successive
ordination, mission, or jurisdictional collation <i>ad
esse</i>, to the being of ministry or church, is but a cheat
of men that have an interest of their own which requireth
such a plea, when they may easily know,
that it would overthrow themselves.</p>

<h3>Quest. XII. <i>Whether there be, or ever was, such a thing in the
world, as one catholic church, constituted by any head besides or
under Christ?</i></h3>

<p>The greatest and first controversy between us and
the papists, is not what man or politic person is the
head of the whole visible church; but, whether
there be any such head at all, either personal, or
collective, monarchical, aristocratical, or democratical
under Christ, of his appointment or allowance?
or any such thing as a catholic church so headed or
constituted? Which they affirm and we deny. That
neither pope nor general council is such a head, I
have proved so fully in my "Key for Catholics" and
other books, that I will not here stay to make repetition
of it. That the pope is no such head, we may
take for granted, 1. Because they bring no proof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">{637}</a></span>
it, whatever they vainly pretend. 2. Because our
divines have copiously disproved it, to whom I refer
you. 3. Because the universal church never received
such a head, as I have proved against Johnson.
4. And whether it be the pope, their bishop
of Chalcedon, <i>ubi supra</i>, et Sancta Clara, "System.
Fid." say is not <i>de fide</i>.</p>

<p>That a council is no such head I have largely
proved as aforesaid, part ii. "Key for Catholics."
And, 1. The use of it being but for concord proveth
it. 2. Most papists confess it. 3. Else there should
be seldom any church in the world for want of a
head, yea, never any.</p>

<p>For I have proved there and to Johnson, that
there never was a true general council of the universal
church; but only imperial councils of the
churches under one emperor's power, and those that
having been under it, had been used to such councils;
and that it is not a thing ever to be attempted
or expected, as being unlawful and morally impossible.<span

of the interest of the church.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XIII. <i>Whether there be such a thing as a visible catholic
church? And what it is?</i></h3>

<p>The ancients differently used the terms, a catholic
church, and, the catholic church. By the first they
meant any particular church which was part of the
universal; by the second they meant the universal
church itself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_244" id="Ref_244" href="#Foot_244">[244]</a></span>
And this is it that we now mean. And
I answer affirmatively, there is a visible universal
church, not only as a community, or as a kingdom
distinct from the king, but as a political society.</p>

<p>2. This church is the universality of baptized
visible christians headed by Jesus Christ himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_245" id="Ref_245" href="#Foot_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>There is this, and there is no other upon earth.
The papists say, that this is no visible church because
the Head is not visible.</p>

<p>I answer, 1. It is not necessary that he be seen,
but visible: and is not Christ a visible person?</p>

<p>2. This church consisteth of two parts, the triumphant
part in glory, and the militant part; and
Christ is not only visible but seen by the triumphant
part: as the king is not seen by the ten-thousandth
part of his kingdoms, but by his courtiers and those
about him, and yet he is king of all.</p>

<p>3. Christ was seen on earth for above thirty
years; and the kingdom may be called visible, in
that the King was once visible on earth, and is
now visible in heaven: as if the king would show
himself to his people but one year together in all
his life.</p>

<p>4. It ill becometh the papists of any men, to say
that Christ is not visible, who make him, see him,
taste him, handle him, eat him, drink him, digest
him in every church, in every mass throughout the
year, and throughout the world; and this not as
divided, but as whole Christ.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But this is not <i>quatenus</i> regent.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> If you see him that is regent, and see his
laws and gospel which are his governing instruments,
together with his ministers who are his
officers, it is enough to denominate his kingdom
visible.</p>

<p>5. The church might be fitly denominated visible
<i>secundum quid</i>, if Christ himself were invisible; because
the politic body is visible, the dispersed officers,
assemblies, and laws are visible. But sure
all these together may well serve for the denomination.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XIV. <i>What is it that maketh a visible member of the
universal church? And who are to be accounted such?</i></h3>

<p>1. Baptism maketh a visible member of the universal
church; and the baptized (as to entrance, unless
they go out again) are to be accounted such.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_246" id="Ref_246" href="#Foot_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>2. By baptism we mean, open devotion or dedication
to God by the baptismal covenant, in which the
adult for themselves, and parents for their infants,
do profess consent to the covenant of grace; which
includeth a belief of all the essential articles of the
faith, and a resolution for sincere obedience; and a
consent to the relations between God and us, viz.
that he be our reconciled Father, our Saviour, and
our Sanctifier.</p>

<p>3. The continuance of this consent is necessary to
the continuance of our visible membership.</p>

<p>4. He that through ignorance, or incapacity for
want of water, or a minister, is not baptized, and yet
is solemnly or notoriously dedicated and devoted to
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, in the same
covenant, though without the outward sign, and professeth
openly the same religion, is a visible christian,
though not by a complete and regular visibility;
as a soldier not listed nor taking his colours, or a
marriage not regularly solemnized, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. He that forsaketh his covenant by apostasy, or
is totally and duly excommunicated, ceaseth to be a
visible member of the church.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XV. <i>Whether besides the profession of christianity, either
testimony or evidence of conversion, or practical godliness, be
necessary to prove a man a member of the universal visible church?</i></h3>

<p>1. As the Mediator is the way to the Father, sent
to recover us to God, so christianity includeth godliness;
and he professeth not christianity, who professeth
not godliness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_247" id="Ref_247" href="#Foot_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>2. He that professeth the baptismal covenant, professeth
christianity, and godliness, and true conversion.
And therefore cannot be rejected for want of
a profession of conversion or godliness.</p>

<p>3. But he that is justly suspected not to understand
his own profession, but to speak general words,
without the sense, may and ought to be examined
by him that is to baptize him; and therefore though
the apostles among the Jews who had been bred up
among the oracles of God, did justly presume of so
much understanding, as that they baptized men the
same day that they professed to believe in Christ;
yet when they baptized converted gentiles, we have
reason to think, that they first received a particular
account of their converts, that they understood the
three essential articles of the covenant.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_248" id="Ref_248" href="#Foot_248">[248]</a></span>
1. Because
the creed is fitted to that use, and hath been ever
used thereunto by the churches, as by tradition from
the apostles' practice. 2. Because the church in all
ages, as far as church history leadeth us upward,
hath used catechising before baptizing; yea, and to
keep men as catechumens some time for preparation.
3. Because common experience telleth us, that multitudes
can say the creed that understand it not.</p>

<p>If any yet urge the apostles' example, I will grant
that it obligeth us when the case is the like (and I
will not fly to any conceit of their heart-searching,
or discerning men's sincerity). When you bring us
to a people that before were the visible church of
God, and were all their lifetime trained up in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">{638}</a></span>
knowledge of God, of sin, of duty, of the promised
Messiah, according to all the law and prophets, and
want nothing, but to know the Son and the Holy
Ghost, that this Jesus is the Christ, who will reconcile
us to God, and give us the sanctifying Spirit,
then we will also baptize men the same day that they
profess to believe in Jesus Christ, and in the Father
as reconciled by him, and the Holy Ghost as given
by him. But if we have those to deal with who
know not God, or sin, or misery, or Scripture prophecies,
no nor natural verities, we know no proof
that the apostles so hastily baptized such.</p>

<p>Of this I have largely spoken in my "Treatise of
Confirmation."</p>

<p>4. It is not necessary to a man's baptism and first
church membership, that he give any testimony of
an antecedent godly life; because it is repentance
and future obedience professed that is his title; and
we must not keep men from covenanting, till we first
see whether they will keep the covenant which they
are to make. For covenanting goeth before covenant
keeping: and it is any, the most impious
sinner, who repenteth, that is to be washed and justified
as soon as he becometh a believer.</p>

<p>5. Yet if any that professeth faith and repentance,
should commit whoredom, drunkenness, murder,
blasphemy, or any mortal sin, before he is
baptized, we have reason to make a stop of that
man's baptism, because he contradicteth his own
profession, and giveth us cause to take it for hypocritical,
till he give us better evidence that he is
penitent indeed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_249" id="Ref_249" href="#Foot_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Heart covenanting maketh an invisible church
member, and verbal covenanting and baptism make
a visible church member. And he that maketh a
profession of christianity, so far as to declare that he
believeth all the articles of the creed particularly
and understandingly, (with some tolerable understanding,
though not distinct enough and full,) and
that he openly devoteth himself to God the Father,
Son, and Spirit, in the vow and covenant of baptism,
doth produce a sufficient title to the relation of a
christian and church member; and no minister may
reject him, for want of telling when, and by what
arguments, means, order, or degrees he was converted.</p>

<p>7. They that forsake these terms of church entrance,
left us by Christ and his apostles, and used
by all the churches in the world, and reject those
that show the title of such a profession, for want of
something more, and set up other, stricter terms of
their own, as necessary to discover men's conversion
and sincerity, are guilty of church tyranny against
men, and usurpation against Christ; and of making
engines to divide the churches, seeing there will
never be agreement on any human devised terms,
but some will be of one side, and some of another,
when they forsake the terms of Christ.</p>

<p>8. Yet if the pastor shall see cause upon suspicion
of hypocrisy, <i>ad melius esse</i>, to put divers questions
to one man more than to another, and to desire further
satisfaction, the catechumens ought in conscience
to answer him, and endeavour his satisfaction.
For a minister is not tied up to speak only such or
such words to the penitent; and he that should say,
I will answer you no further than to repeat the
creed, doth give a man reason to suppose him either
ignorant or proud, and to suspend the reception of
him, though not to deny it. But still <i>ad esse</i> no
terms must be imposed as necessary on the church,
but what the Holy Ghost by the apostles hath
established.</p>

<h3>Quest. XVI. <i>What is necessary to a man's reception into membership
in a particular church, over and above this foresaid title? whether
any other trials, or covenant, or what?</i></h3>

<p>1. A particular church is a regular part of the universal,
as a city of a kingdom, or a troop of an army.</p>

<p>2. Every man that is a member of the particular
church, is a member of the universal; but every one
that is a member of the universal church, is not a
member of a particular.</p>

<p>3. Every particular church hath its own particular
pastor, (one or more,) and its own particular place or
bounds of habitation or residence; therefore he that
will be a member of a particular church, 1. Must cohabit,
or live in a proximity capable of communion.
2. And must consent to be a member of that particular
church, and to be under the guidance of its particular
pastor, in their office work. For he cannot
be made a member without his own consent and will;
nor can he be a member, that subjecteth not himself
to the governor or guide.</p>

<p>4. He therefore that will intrude into their communion
and privileges without expressing his consent
beforehand to be a member, and to submit to
the pastoral oversight, is to be taken for an invader.</p>

<p>5. But no other personal qualification is to be exacted
of him as necessary, but that he be a member
of the church universal. As he is not to be baptized
again, so neither to give again all that account
of his faith and repentance particularly which he
gave at baptism; much less any higher proofs of his
sincerity; but if he continue in the covenant and
church state which he was baptized into, he is capable
thereby of reception into any particular church
upon particular consent. Nor is there any Scripture
proof of any new examinations about their conversion
or sincerity, at their removals or entrance into
a particular church.</p>

<p>6. But yet because he is not now looked on only
as a covenant maker, as he was at baptism, but also
as a covenant keeper or performer, therefore if any
can prove that he is false to his baptismal covenant,
by apostasy, heresy, or a wicked life, he is to be refused
till he be absolved upon his renewed repentance.</p>

<p>7. He that oft professeth to repent, and by oft revolting
into mortal sin, (that is, sin which showeth
a state of death,) doth show that he was not sincere,
must afterward show his repentance by actual amendment,
before he can say, it is his due to be believed.</p>

<p>8. Whether you will call this consent to particular
church relation and duty, by the name of a covenant
or not, is but <i>lis de nomine</i>: it is more than mutual
consent that is necessary to be expressed; and mutual
consent expressed may be called a covenant.</p>

<p>9. <i>Ad melius esse</i>, the more express the consent or
covenant is, the better: for in so great matters men
should know what they do, and deal above-board:
especially when experience telleth us, that ignorance
and imagery is ready to eat out the heart of religion
in almost all the churches in the world. But yet <i>ad
esse</i> churches must see that they feign or make no
more covenants necessary than God hath made; because
human, unnecessary inventions have so long
distracted and laid waste the churches of Christ.</p>

<p>10. The pastor's consent must concur with the
persons to be received: for it must be mutual consent;
and as none can be a member, so none may be
a pastor, against his will.<span

And though he be under
Christ's laws what persons to receive, and is not arbitrary
to do what he list, yet he is the guide of the
church, and the discerner of his own duty. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">{639}</a></span>
a pastor may have reasons to refuse to take a man
into his particular charge, without rejecting him as
unworthy. Perhaps he may already have more in
number than he can well take care of. And other
such reasons may fall out.</p>

<p>11. In those countries where the magistrate's
laws and common consent, do take every qualified
person for a member of that church where his habitation
is, (called a parish,) and to which he ordinarily
resorteth, the pastor that undertaketh that
charge, doth thereby seem to consent to be pastor to
all such persons in that parish. And there cohabitation
and ordinary conjunction with the church, may
go for a signification of consent, and instead of more
particular contract or covenant, by virtue of the exposition
of the said laws and customs. Yet so, that
a man is not therefore to be taken for a member of
the church merely because he liveth in the parish;
for so atheists, infidels, heretics, and papists may do;
but because he is, 1. A parishioner, 2. Qualified,
3. Joining with the church, and actually submitting
to the ministry.</p>

<p>12. Where there is this much only, it is a sinful
slander to say that such a parish is no true church
of Christ; however there may be many desirable
orders wanting to its better being. Who hath the
power of trying and receiving we shall show anon.</p>

<h3>Quest. XVII. <i>Wherein doth the ministerial office essentially
consist?</i></h3>

<p>The office of the sacred ministry is a mixed relation
(not a simple).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_251" id="Ref_251" href="#Foot_251">[251]</a></span>
I. As the minister is related
to Christ, he is his servant or minister by office; that
is, one commissioned by him for that sacred work:
where there is, 1. The commission itself (which is
not particular, but general, in a general law, applicable
to each singular person when qualified).
2. The determination of the individual person who
is to receive it: which consisteth in the call, which
I have opened before and therefore repeat not. Only
note again, 1. That by virtue of the general commission
or institution of the office in specie, the power
is conveyed from Christ to the individual person, and
that the church (electors or ordainers) are not the
donors, authorizers, or obligers, but only instruments
of designing an apt recipient, and delivering him
possession. 2. That by virtue of this institution,
charter, or law commission, it is that the acts of a
man seemingly or visibly called, are valid to the
church, though really he were not ordained or truly
called, but deceived them by hypocritical intrusion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_252" id="Ref_252" href="#Foot_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The causation or efficiency of Christ in the
making any one a minister, is, 1. Dispositive, making
him a qualified, fit recipient; 2. Then applying the
general commission to him, or giving him the function
itself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_253" id="Ref_253" href="#Foot_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The dispositive acts of Christ are, 1. Giving
him competent knowledge for a minister. 2. Giving
him competent goodness; that is, love to God, truth,
and souls, and willingness for the work. 3. Giving
him competent power and abilities for execution,
which is principally in utterance; and so qualifying
his intellect, will, and executive power.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_254" id="Ref_254" href="#Foot_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The immediate conveyance or act of collation,
is, 1. An obligation laid on the person to do the
work. 2. Authority given him to warrant him, and
to oblige others; that is, a <i>jus docendi, gubernandi, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>3. The form of the relation is denominated,
1. From the reception of these efficiencies in general.
2. From the subordination which hereby they are
placed in to Christ, as their relation is denominated
<i>a termino</i>.</p>

<p>1. Formally the office consisteth in, 1. An obligation
to do the work of the office. 2. Authority to do
it, and to oblige others to submit to it.</p>

<p>2. These make up an office which being denominated
also from the <i>terminus</i>, is considered, 1. As to
the nearest term, which is the work to be done.
2. The remote, which is the object of that work.</p>

<p>The work is, 1. Teaching: 2. Ruling: 3. Worshipping.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_255" id="Ref_255" href="#Foot_255">[255]</a></span>
And so it is essentially An obligation
and power of ministerial teaching, ruling, and worshipping
God.</p>

<p>2. As to the object it is, 1. The world to be converted.
2. The converted to be baptized, and congregated
or ordered into particular societies (so far
as may be). 3. The baptized and congregate to be,
(1.) Taught; (2.) Ruled; (3.) Guided in worship.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_256" id="Ref_256" href="#Foot_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>From all which resulteth an office which is ministerially
subordinate to Christ, 1. The Prophet or
Teacher; 2. The Ruler; 3. The High Priest and Lover
of his church; and it may be aptly called both a teaching
ministry, a ruling ministry, (not by the sword,
but by the word,) and a priesthood or priestly ministry.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_257" id="Ref_257" href="#Foot_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>II. As the pastor is related to the church, he is,
1. A constitutive part of particular political churches.
2. He is Christ's minister for the church and for
Christ; that is, to teach, rule, and worship with the
church. He is above the church, and greater than
it, as to order and power, and not the minister of
the church as the efficient of the ministry: but he is
less and worse than the church finally and materially;
and is finally the church's minister, as the physician
is the patient's physician; not made a physician by
him, but chosen and used as his physician for his cure:
so that to speak properly, he is not from them, but
for them. He is Christ's minister for their good;
as the shepherd is his master's servant, for his flock,
and so finally only the servant of the sheep.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_258" id="Ref_258" href="#Foot_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole uncontrovertible work of the office is laid
down in my small book called "Universal Concord,"
to which I must refer you.</p>

<h3>Quest. XVIII. <i>Whether the people's choice or consent is necessary
to the office of a minister in his first work, as he is to convert
infidels, and baptize them? And whether this be a work of office? And
what call is necessary to it?</i></h3>

<p>I conjoin these three distinct questions for expedition.</p>

<p>1. That it is part of the minister's office work to
teach, convert, and baptize men, to bring them out
of the world into the church, is undeniable; 1. In
Christ's express commission, Matt. xxviii. 19, 20,
"Go, disciple me all nations, baptizing them&mdash;"
2. In the execution of this commission.</p>

<p>2. That this was not peculiar to the apostles or
their age is proved, 1. Because not an extraordinary
work, like miracles, &amp;c. but the first great business
of the gospel and ministry in the world. 2. Because
others as well as the apostles did it in that age, and
ever since. 3. Because the promise is annexed to
the office thus described, "I am with you always to
the end of the world." Or if you translate it "age,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">{640}</a></span>
it is the age of the church of the Messiah incarnate,
which is all one. 4. Because it was a small part of
the world comparatively that heard the gospel in the
apostles' days.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_259" id="Ref_259" href="#Foot_259">[259]</a></span>
And the far greatest part of the
world is without it at this day, when yet God our
Saviour would have all men to be saved, and to
come to the knowledge of the truth. 5. Even where
the gospel hath long continued, for the most part
there are many still that are in infidelity. And so
great a work is not left without an appointed suitable
means for its performance: and if an office
was necessary for it in the first age, it is not
credible that it is left to private men's charity ever
since. 6. Especially considering that private men
are to be supposed insufficient; (1.) Because they
are not educated purposely for it, but usually for
something else. (2.) Because that they have other
callings to take them up. (3.) Because they have
no special obligation. And that which is no man's
peculiar work, is usually left undone by all.</p>

<p>II. The people's call or consent is not necessary to
a minister's reception of his office in general, nor
for this part of his work in special; but only to his
pastoral relation to themselves.</p>

<p>1. It is so in other functions that are exercised by
skill. The patients or people make not a man a
physician or lawyer, but only choose what physician
shall be their physician, and what lawyer shall be
their counsellor.</p>

<p>2. If the people's call or consent be necessary, it
is either the infidels' or the church's. Not the infidels
to whom he is to preach: for, 1. He is authorized
to preach to them (as the apostles were) before
he goeth to them. 2. Their consent is but a natural
consequent requisite for the reception and success
of their teaching, but not to the authority which is
prerequisite. 3. Infidels cannot do so much towards
the making of a minister of Christ. 4. Else Christ
would have few such ministers. 5. If it be infidels,
either all or some? If some, why those rather than
others? Or is a man made a minister by every infidel
auditory that heareth him?</p>

<p>2. Nor is it christian people that must do this
much to the making of a general minister: for, 1.
They have no such power given for it, in nature or
the word of God. 2. They are generally unqualified
and unable for such a work. 3. They are no where
obliged to it, nor can fitly leave their callings for it;
much less to get the abilities necessary to judge.
4. Which of the people have this power? Is it any
of them, or any church of private men? or some
one more than the rest? Neither one nor all can
lay any claim to it. There is some reason why this
congregation rather than another should choose
their own pastors; but there is no reason (nor Scripture)
that this congregation choose a minister to
convert the world.</p>

<p>III. I conclude therefore that the call of a minister
in general doth consist, 1. Dispositively in the
due qualifications and enablement of the person.
2. And the necessity of the people, with opportunity,
is a providential part of the call. 3. And the ordainers
are the orderly electors and determiners of
the person that shall receive the power from Christ.</p>

<p>1. For this is part of the power of the keys or
church government. 2. And Paul giveth this direction
for exercising of this power to Timothy, which
showeth the ordinary way of calling; 2&nbsp;Tim. ii. 2,
"And the things which thou hast heard of me among
many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful
men, who shall be able to teach others also."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_260" id="Ref_260" href="#Foot_260">[260]</a></span>
Acts xiii. 1-3, "There were in the church at Antioch
certain prophets&mdash;As they ministered to the Lord,
the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and
Saul for the work whereunto I have called them;
and when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their
hands on them, they sent them away. And they
being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed." In
this (whether it be called an ordination, or rather a
mission) there is somewhat ordinary, (that it be by
men in office,) and somewhat extraordinary (that it
be by a special inspiration of the Holy Ghost).</p>

<p>And Timothy received his gifts and office by the
imposition of the hands of Paul and of the presbytery.
1&nbsp;Tim. iv. 14; 2&nbsp;Tim. i. 6, 1&nbsp;Tim. v. 22, "Lay
hands suddenly on no man."</p>

<p>These instances make the case the clearer, 1. Because
it is certain that all the governing power
which is given by Christ to the church under the
name of the keys, is given to the pastors. 2. Because
there are no other competitors to lay a reasonable
claim to it.</p>

<h3>Quest. XIX. <i>Wherein consistent the power and nature of ordination?
And to whom doth it belong? And is it an act of jurisdiction? And is
imposition of hands necessary in it?</i></h3>

<p>I. This is resolved on the by before. 1. Ordination
performeth two things: (1.) The designation,
election, or determination of the person who shall
receive the office. (2.) The ministerial investiture
of him in that office; which is a ceremonial delivery
of possession; as a servant doth deliver possession
of a house by delivering him the key, who hath before
received the power or right from the owner.</p>

<p>2. The office delivered by this election and investiture,
is the sacred ministerial office in general to
be after exercised according to particular calls and
opportunities; as Christ called the apostles, and the
Spirit called the ordinary general teachers of those
times; such as Barnabas, Silas, Silvanus, Timothy,
Epaphroditus, Apollos, &amp;c. And as is before cited,
2&nbsp;Tim. ii. 2. As a man is made in general a licensed
physician, lawyer, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. This ordination is <i>ordinis gratia</i>, necessary to
order; and therefore so far necessary as order is
necessary; which is ordinarily, when the greater
interest of the substantial duty, or of the thing
ordered, is not against it. As Christ determined the
case of sabbath keeping, and not eating the shewbread.
As the sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the sabbath, and the end is to be preferred
before the separable means; so ordination was instituted
for order, and order for the thing ordered,
and for the work of the gospel, and the good of souls,
and not the gospel and men's souls for that order.
Therefore when, 1. The death; 2. Distance; 3. Or
malignity of the ordainers depriveth a man of ordination,
these three substitutes may notify to him the
will of God, that he is by him a person called to that
office: 1. Fitness for the works, in understanding,
willingness, and ability; 2. The necessity of souls;
3. Opportunity.</p>

<p>II. The power of ordaining belongeth not, 1. To
magistrates; 2. Or to private men, either single or
as the body of a church; but, 3. To the senior
pastors of the church (whether bishops or presbyters
of a distinct order, the reader must not expect
that I here determine).</p>

<p>For, 1. The power is by Christ given to them, as
is before proved; and in Tit. i. 5.</p>

<p>2. None else are ordinarily able to discern aright
the abilities of a man for the sacred ministry. The
people may discern a profitable moving preacher,
but whether he understand the Scripture, or the substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">{641}</a></span>
of religion, or be sound in the faith and not
heretical, and delude them not with a form of well-uttered
words, they are not ordinarily able to judge.</p>

<p>3. None else are fit to attend this work, but pastors
who are separated to the sacred office.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_261" id="Ref_261" href="#Foot_261">[261]</a></span>
It requireth
more time to get fitness for it, and then to perform
it faithfully, than either magistrates or people can
ordinarily bestow.</p>

<p>4. The power is no where given by Christ to
magistrates or people.</p>

<p>5. It hath been exercised by pastors or church
officers only, both in and ever since the apostles'
days, in all the churches of the world. And we have
no reason to think that the church hath been gathered
from the beginning till now, by so great an error,
as a wrong conveyance of the ministerial power.</p>

<p>III. The word jurisdiction as applied to the church
officers, is no Scripture word, and in the common
sense soundeth too big, as signifying more power
than the servants of all must claim; for there is
"one Lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_262" id="Ref_262" href="#Foot_262">[262]</a></span>
But in a more moderate sense it may be tolerated;
as jurisdiction signifieth in particular, 1. Legislation;
2. Or judicial process or sentence; 3. Or the
execution of such a sentence, strictly taken; so ordination
is no part of jurisdiction. But as jurisdiction
signifieth the same with the power of government,
<i>jus regendi</i> in general; so ordination is an act of
jurisdiction. As the placing or choosing of inferior
officers may belong to the steward of a family, or as
the calling or authorizing of physicians belongeth
to the college of physicians, and the authorizing of
lawyers to the judges' society, or the authorizing of
doctors in philosophy to the society of philosophers
or to particular rulers. Where note, that in the
three last instances, the learning or fitness of the
said persons or societies, is but their <i>dispositio vel
aptitudo ad potestatem exercendam</i>; but the actual
power of conveying authority to others, or designing
the recipient person, is received from the supreme
power of the land, and so is properly an act of
authority, here called jurisdiction.</p>

<p>So that the common distinguishing of ordination
from jurisdiction or government, as if they were
<i>tota specie</i> different, is unsound.</p>

<p>IV. Imposition of hands was a sign, (like the kiss
of peace, and the anointing of persons, and like our
kneeling in prayer, &amp;c.) which having first somewhat
in their nature to invite men to the use, was
become a common significant sign, of a superior's
benediction of an inferior, in those times and countries.
And so was here applied ordinarily for its antecedent
significancy and aptitude to this use; and was not
purposely instituted, nor had its significancy newly
given it by institution; and so was not like a sacrament
necessarily and perpetually affixed to ordination.</p>

<p>Therefore we must conclude, 1. That imposition
of hands in ordination is a decent, apt, significant
sign, not to be scrupled by any, nor to be omitted
without necessity, as being of Scripture, ancient,
and common use.</p>

<p>2. But yet that it is not essential to ordination;
which may be valid by any fit designation and separation
of the person. And therefore if it be omitted,
it nullifieth not the action. And if the ordainers did
it by letters to a man a thousand miles off, it would
be valid: and some persons of old were ordained
when they were absent.</p>

<p>V. I add as to the need of ordination, 1. That without
this key, the office and church doors would be
cast open, and every heretic or self-conceited person
intrude.</p>

<p>2. It is a sign of a proud, unworthy person, that
will judge himself fit for so great a work, and intrude
upon such a conceit, when he may have the judgment
of the pastors, and avoideth it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_263" id="Ref_263" href="#Foot_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Those that so do, should no more be taken for
ministers by the people, than any should go for
christians that are not baptized, or for married persons
whose marriage is not solemnized.</p>

<h3>Quest. XX. <i>Is ordination necessary to make a man a pastor of a
particular church as such? And is he to be made a general minister and
a particular church elder or pastor at once, and by one ordination?</i></h3>

<p>I have proved that a man may be made a minister
in general, yea, and sent to exercise it in converting
infidels, and baptizing them, before ever he is the
pastor of any particular church. To which I add,
that in this general ministry, he is a pastor in the
universal church, as a licensed physician that hath
no hospital or charge, is a physician in the kingdom.</p>

<p>And, 1. As baptism is as such our entrance into
the universal church, and not into a particular; so
is ordination to a minister an entrance only on the
ministry as such.</p>

<p>2. Yet a man may at once be made a minister in
general, and the pastor of this or that church in
particular: and in kingdoms wholly inchurched and
christian, it is usually fittest so to do; lest many
being ordained <i>sine titulo</i>, idleness and poverty of
supernumeraries, should corrupt and dishonour the
ministry: which was the cause of the old canons in
this case.</p>

<p>3. But when a man is thus called to both at once,
it is not all done by ordination as such; but his
complicate relation proceedeth from a complication
of causes. As he is a minister, it is by ordination.
And as he is the pastor of this people, it is by the
conjunct causes of appropriation: which are, 1. Necessarily
the people's consent. 2. Regularly, the
pastor's approbation and recommendation, and reception
of the person into their communion. 3. And
sometimes the magistrate may do much to oblige the
people to consent.</p>

<p>4. But when a man is made a minister in general
before, he needeth no proper ordination to fix him in
a particular charge; but only an approbation, recommendation,
particular investiture, and reception.
For else a man must be oft ordained, even as oft as
he removeth. But yet imposition of hands may
fitly be used in this particular investiture, though it
be no proper ordination, that is, no collation of the
office of a minister in general, but the fixing of one
that was a minister before.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXI. <i>May a man be oft or twice ordained?</i></h3>

<p>It is supposed, that we play not with an ambiguous
word, that we remember what ordination is. And
then you will see cause to distinguish, 1. Between
entire, true ordination, and the external act, or words,
or ceremony only. 2. Between one that was truly
ordained before, and one that was not. And so I
answer,</p>

<p>1. He that seemed ordained, and indeed was not,
is not re-ordained when he is after-ordained.</p>

<p>2. It is needful therefore to know the essentials of
ordination, from the integrals and accidentals.</p>

<p>3. He that was truly ordained before, may in some
cases receive again the repetition of the bare words
and outward ceremonies of ordination (as imposition
of hands). Where I will, I. Tell you in what cases.
II. Why.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">{642}</a></span>
I. 1. In case there wanted sufficient witnesses of
his ordination; and so the church hath not sufficient
means of notice or satisfaction, that ever he was ordained
indeed: or if the witnesses die before the
notification. Whether the church should take his
word or not, in such a case, is none of my question,
but, Whether he should submit to the repetition if
they will not.</p>

<p>2. Especially in a time and place (which I have
known) when written and sealed orders are often
counterfeited, and so the church called to extraordinary
care.</p>

<p>3. Or if the church or magistrate be guilty of
some causeless, culpable incredulity, and will not
believe it was done till they see it done again.</p>

<p>4. Or in case that some real or supposed integral
(though not essential) part was omitted, or is by the
church or magistrate supposed to be omitted; and
they will not permit or receive the minister to exercise
his office, unless he repeat the whole action
again, and make up that defect.</p>

<p>5. Or if the person himself do think that his ordination
was insufficient, and cannot exercise his
ministry to the satisfaction of his own conscience,
till the defect be repaired.</p>

<p>In these cases (and perhaps such others) the outward
action may be repeated.</p>

<p>II. The reasons are, 1. Because this is not a being
twice ordained. For the word ordination, signifieth
a moral action, and not a physical only; as the word
marriage doth, &amp;c. And it essentially includeth
the new dedication and designation to the sacred
office, by a kind of covenant between the dedicated
person and Christ to whom he is consecrated and
devoted. And the external words are but a part,
and a part only as significant of the action of the
mind. Now the oft expressing of the same mental
dedication doth not make it to be as many distinct
dedications. For, 1. If the liturgy or the person's
words were tautological, or at the ordination should
say the same thing often over and over, or for confirmation
should say often that which else might be
said but once, this doth not make it an often or multiplied
ordination: it was but one love which Peter
expressed, when Christ made him say thrice, that he
loved him; nor was it a threefold ordination which
Christ used, when he said thrice to him, "Feed my
lambs and sheep."</p>

<p>2. And if thrice saying it that hour make it not
three ordinations, neither will thrice saying it at
more hours, days, or months, or years distance, in
some cases; for the time maketh not the ordinations
to be many; it is but one moral action. But the
common error ariseth from the custom of calling the
outward action alone by the name of the whole
moral action (which is ordinarily done to the like
deceit in the case of the baptismal covenant, and the
Lord's supper).</p>

<p>3. The common judgment and custom of the world
confirmeth what I say. If persons that are married
should for want of witness or due solemnity be
forced to say and do the outward action all over
again, it is by no wise man taken in the proper,
moral, full sense, for a second marriage, but for one
marriage twice uttered.</p>

<p>And if you should in witness-bearing be put to
your oath, and the magistrate that was absent should
say, Reach him the book again, I did not hear him
swear, the doing it twice is not morally two witnessings
or oaths, but one only twice physically uttered.</p>

<p>If you bind your son apprentice, or if you make
any indentures or contract, and the writings being
lost or faulty, you write, and sign, and seal them all
again, this is not morally another contract, but the
same done better, or again recorded. And so it is
plainly in this case.</p>

<p>4. But re-ordination morally and properly so
called, is unlawful: for, (1.) It is (or implieth) a lie,
viz. that we were not truly dedicated and separated
to this office before.</p>

<p>(2.) It is a sacrilegious renunciation of our former
dedication to God: whereas the ministerial dedication
and covenant is for life, and not for a trial;
which is the meaning of the indelible character,
which is a perpetual relation and obligation.</p>

<p>(3.) It is a taking the name of God in vain; thus
to do and undo, and do again; and to promise and
renounce, and promise again, and to pretend to receive
a power which we had before.</p>

<p>(4.) It tendeth to great confusions in the church;
as to make the people doubt of their baptism, or all
the ministerial administrations of such as are re-ordained,
while they acted by the first ordination.</p>

<p>(5.) It hath ever been condemned in the churches
of Christ, as the canons called the apostles', and the
church's constant practice, testify.</p>

<p>5. Though the bare repetition of the outward
action and words be not re-ordination, yet he that
on any of the forementioned occasions is put to repeat
the said words and actions, is obliged so to do
it, as that it may not seem to be a re-ordination, and
so be a scandal to the church. Or if it outwardly
seem so by the action, he is bound to declare that it
is no such thing, for the counterpoising that appearance
of evil.</p>

<p>6. When the ordainers, or the common estimation
of the church, do take the repetition of the words
and action for a re-ordination, though the receiver
so intend it not, yet it may become unlawful to him
by this accident, because he scandalizeth and hardeneth
the erroneous, by doing or receiving that which
is interpretative re-ordination.</p>

<p>7. Especially when the ordainers shall require
this repetition on notoriously wicked grounds, and
so put that sense on the action by their own doctrines
and demands: as for instance,</p>

<p>(1.) If heretics should (as the Arians) say that we
are no ministers, because we are not of their heresy,
or ordained by such as they.</p>

<p>(2.) If the pope or any proud papal usurpers shall
say, You are no ministers of Christ, except we ordain
you; and so do it to establish a traitorous, usurped
regiment in the church; it is not lawful to serve
such a usurpation. As if cardinals or archbishops
should say, None are true ministers but those that
we ordain; or councils or synods of bishops or presbyters
should say, None are true ministers but those
that we ordain; or if one presbyter or one bishop
without authority would thus make himself master
of the rest, or of other churches, and say, You are no
ministers unless I ordain you; we may not promote
such tyranny and usurpation.</p>

<p>(3.) If magistrates would usurp the power of the
keys, in ecclesiastical ordination, and say that none
but they have power to ordain, we may not encourage
such pretences by repetition of the words and
action.</p>

<p>(4.) If they would make something necessary to
ordination which is not, as if it were a false oath, or
false subscription or profession, or some unlawful
ceremony, (as if it were anointing, wearing horns,
or any the like,) and say, You are no ministers without
these, and therefore you must be re-ordained to
receive them.</p>

<p>(5.) Yea, if they declare our former ministry causelessly
to be null, and say, You are no ministers till
you are ordained again, and so publicly put this
sense upon our action, that we take it as re-ordination;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">{643}</a></span>
all these accidents make the repetition of the
words and actions to be unlawful, unless when greater
accidents notoriously preponderate.</p>

<p><i>Quest.</i> But if such church tyrants should have so
great power, as that without their repetition of ordination
on those terms, the ministry might not be exercised,
is it lawful so to take it in a case of such
necessity?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Every seeming necessity to you, is not a
necessity to the church. 2. Either you may publicly
declare a contrary sense in your receiving their new
orders or not.</p>

<p>1. If you may not as publicly declare that you renounce
not your former ministry and dedication to
God in that office, as the ordainers declare their
sense of the nullity of it, so that your open declaration
may free you from the guilt of seeming consent,
I conceive it is a sinful compliance with their sin.
2. Yea, if you may so declare it, yet if there be no
necessity of your ministerial liberty in that place, I
think you may not take it on such terms. As, (1.)
If there be worthy men enough to supply the
church's wants there without you. (2.) And if you
may serve God successfully in a persecuted state,
though to the suffering of your flesh. (3.) Or if
your imprisonment for preaching be like to be as
serviceable to the church and gospel as your continued
preaching on those scandalous terms. (4.)
Or if you may remove and preach in another country.</p>

<p>8. When any such case doth fall out, in which the
repetition of the outward action and words is lawful,
it is not lawful to mix any false and scandalous expressions:
as if we were required to say falsely, I
accept this ordination as confessing myself no minister
of Christ till now: or any such like.</p>

<p>9. In a word, a peaceable christian may do much
as to the mere outward action and submission, for
obedience, peace, order, or satisfaction to his own or
other men's consciences. But, (1.) He may do nothing
for good ends which is false and injurious to
the church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_264" id="Ref_264" href="#Foot_264">[264]</a></span>
(2.) And he may not do that which
otherwise were lawful, when it is for evil ends, or
tendeth to more hurt than good; as to promote
heresy, or church tyranny and usurpation, whether
in pope, prelates, presbyters, or people.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXII. <i>How many ordainers are necessary to the validity of
ordination by God's institution? whether one or more?</i></h3>

<p>My question is not of the ancient canons, or any
human laws or customs, for those are easily known;
but of divine right. Now either God hath determined
the case as to the number of ordainers necessary,
or not. If not, either he hath given the church
some general rule to determine it by, or not. If not,
then the number is not any part of the divine order
or law; and then, if we suppose that he hath determined
the case as to the ordaining office and not to
the number, then it will follow that one may serve.
The truth I think may be thus explained.</p>

<p>1. There is <i>Ordo officialis primarius</i>, and <i>Ordo ordinis,
vel exercitii, vel secundarius</i>; an order of office
primary, and an order of exercise secondary, in the
church. As to the first, the order of office, God hath
determined that the ordaining officers, and no others,
shall ordain officers, or give orders. And having
not determined whether one or more, it followeth
that the ordination of one sole lawful ordainer is no
nullity on that account because it is but one, unless
somewhat else nullify it.</p>

<p>2. God hath given general rules to the ordainers
for the due exercise of their office, though he have
not determined of any set number. Such as are
these: that all things be done in judgment, truth,
love, concord, to the church's edification, unity, and
peace, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. According to these general laws, sometimes the
ordination of one sole ordainer, may not only be
valid but regular; as when there are no other to
concur, or none whose concurrence is needful to any
of the aforesaid ends. And sometimes the concurrence
of many is needful, (1.) To the receiver's satisfaction.
(2.) To the church's or people's satisfaction.
(3.) To the concord of pastors, and of neighbour
churches, &amp;c. And in such cases such consent
or concourse is the regular way.</p>

<p>4. Where there are many neighbour pastors and
churches so near, as that he that is ordained in one
of them, is like oft to pass and preach, and officiate
<i>obiter</i> in others, and so other churches must have
some communion with him, it is meetest that there
be a concurrence in the ordination.</p>

<p>5. The ordainer is certainly a superior to the person
that cometh to be ordained while he is a private
man; and therefore so far his ordination is (as is
said) an act of jurisdiction in the large sense, that is,
of government; but whether he be necessarily his
superior after he is ordained, hath too long been a
controversy. It is certain that the papists confess,
that the pope is ordained such by no superior; and
it is not necessary that a bishop be ordained by one
or more of any superior order (or jurisdiction either).
And though the Italian papists hold that a superior
papal jurisdiction must needs be the secondary fountain
of the ordaining power, though the ordainer
himself be but of the same order; yet protestants
hold no such thing. And all acknowledge that as
imposition of hands on a layman to make him a
minister of Christ or an officer, is a kind of official
generation,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_265" id="Ref_265" href="#Foot_265">[265]</a></span>
so the ordained as a junior in office, is
as it were a son to the ordainer, as the convert is
said to be peculiarly to his converter; and that a
proportionable honour is still to be given him. But
whether he that ordaineth a presbyter, and not he
that ordaineth or consecrateth a bishop, must needs
be of a superior order or office, is a question which
the reader must not expect me here to meddle with.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XXIII. <i>What if one bishop ordain a minister, and three, or
many, or all the rest protest against it, and declare him no minister,
or degrade him; is he to be received as a true minister or not?</i></h3>

<p>Supposing that the person want no necessary personal
qualification for the office, there are two things
more in question; 1. His office, whether he be a
minister. 2. His regularity, whether he came regularly
to it; and also his comparative relation,
whether this man or another is to be preferred. I
answer therefore,</p>

<p>1. If the person be utterly incapable, the one
bishop, or the many whosoever taketh him for incapable,
is for the truth sake to be believed and
obeyed.</p>

<p>2. If the man be excellently qualified, and his
ministry greatly necessary to the church, whoever
would deprive the church of him, be it the one or the
many, is to be disobeyed, and the ordainers preferred.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But who shall judge? <i>Answ.</i> The <i>esse</i> is
before the <i>scire</i>; the thing is first true or false before
I judge it to be so; and therefore whoever judgeth
falsely in a case so notorious and weighty, as that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">{644}</a></span>
welfare of the church and souls is (<i>consideratis considerandis</i>)
injured and hazarded by his error, is not
to be believed nor obeyed on pretence of order; because
all christians have <i>judicium discretionis</i>, a discerning
judgment.</p>

<p>3. But if the case be not thus to be determined by
the person's notorious qualifications, then either it
is, 1. The man ordained. 2. Or the people that the
case is debated by, whether they should take him for
a minister. 3. Or the neighbour ministers.</p>

<p>1. The person himself is, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, more to
regard the judgment of many concordant bishops,
than of one singular bishop; and therefore is not to
take orders from a singular bishop, when the generality
of the wise and faithful are against it; unless
he be sure that it is some notorious faction or error
that perverteth them, and that there be notorious
necessity of his labour.</p>

<p>2. The auditors are either infidels to be converted,
(and these will take no man upon any of their authorities,)
or else christians converted. These are either
of the particular charge of the singular bishop who
ordaineth, or not; if they be, then <i>pro tempore</i> for
order's sake, they owe him a peculiar obedience, till
some further process or discovery disoblige them,
(though the most be on the other side). But yet
they may be still bound in reason most to suspect
the judgment of their singular bishop, while for
order's sake they submit to it. But if they are not
of his flock, then, I suppose the judgment and act of
many is to prevail so much against the act of a
single and singular person, as that both neighbour
ministers and people are to disown such an ordained
person as unfit for their communion under the notion
of a minister (because communion of churches
is maintained by the concord of pastors). But
whether the ordained man's ministry be, by their
contradictory declaration or degradation, made an
absolute nullity, to himself and those that submit to
him, neither I will determine, nor should any other
strangers to the particular case; for if he be rejected
or degraded without such cause and proof as may
satisfy other sober persons, he hath wrong; but if
he be so degraded, on proved sufficient cause, to
them that it is known to, he giveth the degraders the
advantage.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_266" id="Ref_266" href="#Foot_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>And as, 1. All particular members are to be obedient
to their proper pastor.</p>

<p>2. And all particular churches are to hold correspondency
and communion according to their capacity.
So must men act in this and such like cases respectively
according to the laws of obedience to their
pastor, and of concord of the churches.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXIV. <i>Hath one bishop power by divine right to ordain,
degrade, or govern, or excommunicate, or absolve, in another's diocess
or church, either by his consent, or against it? And doth a minister
that officiateth in another's church, act as a pastor, and their
pastor, or as a private man? And doth the ministerial office cease
when a man removeth from his flock?</i></h3>

<p>I thrust these questions all together for their
affinity, and for brevity.</p>

<p>1. Every true minister of Christ, bishop or pastor,
is related to the universal church by stronger obligations
than to his particular charge; as the whole
is better than the parts, and its welfare to be preferred.</p>

<p>2. He that is no pastor of a particular church,
may be a pastor in the universal, obliged as a consecrated
person to endeavour its good, by the works
of his office, as he hath a particular opportunity and
call.</p>

<p>3. Yet he that hath a particular charge is especially
and nearlier related and obliged to that
charge or church, than to any other part of the universal
(though not than to the whole); and consequently
hath a peculiar authority, where he hath a
peculiar obligation and work.</p>

<p>4. He that is (without degrading) removed from a
particular church, doth not cease to be a general
minister and pastor related to the universal church;
as a physician put out of an hospital charge, is a physician
still. And therefore he needeth no new ordination,
but only a special designation to his next
particular charge.</p>

<p>5. No man is the bishop of a diocess as to the
measure of ground, or the place, by divine right, that
is, by any particular law or determination of God;
but only a bishop of the church or people: for your
office essentially containeth a relation to the people,
but accidentally only to the place.</p>

<p>6. Yet natural convenience, and God's general
laws of order and edification, do make it usually (but
not always) best, and therefore a duty, to distinguish
churches by the people's habitation: not taking a
man for a member <i>eo nomine</i>, because he liveth on
that ground; but for order's sake taking none for
members that live not on that ground, and not intruding
causelessly into each other's bounds.</p>

<p>7. He that by the call or consent of a neighbour
pastor and people doth officiate (by preaching, sacraments,
excommunication, or absolution) in another's
special charge for a day, or week, or month, or more,
without a fixed relation to that flock, doth neither
officiate as a layman, nor yet unlawfully or irregularly;
but, 1. As a minister of Christ in the church
universal. 2. And as the pastor of that church for
the present time only, though not statedly; even as
a physician called to help another in his hospital, or
to supply his place for the time, doth perform his
work, 1. As a licensed physician. 2. And as the
physician of that patient or hospital for that time,
though not statedly.</p>

<p>8. No man is to intrude into another's charge
without a call; much less to claim a particular stated
oversight and authority. For though he be not a
usurper as to the office in general, he is a usurper as
to that particular flock. It is no error in ordination
to say, Take thou authority to preach the word of
God, and administer the holy sacraments, when thou
shalt be thereto lawfully called; that is, when thou
hast a particular call to the exercise, and to a fixed
charge, as thou hast now a call to the office in general.</p>

<p>9. Yet every bishop or pastor by his relation to
the church universal, and to mankind, and the interest
of Christ, is bound not only as a christian, but as a
pastor, to do his best for the common good; and not
to cast wholly out of his care a particular church,
because another hath the oversight of it. Therefore
if a heretic get in, or the church fall to heresy, or
any pernicious error or sin, the neighbour pastors
are bound both by the law of nature and their office,
to interpose their counsel as ministers of Christ,
and to prefer the substance before pretended order,
and to seek to recover the people's souls, though it
be against their proper pastor's will. And in such a
case of necessity, they may ordain, degrade, excommunicate,
and absolve in another's charge, as if it
were a vacuity.</p>

<p>10. Moreover it is one thing to excommunicate a
man out of a particular church, and another thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">{645}</a></span>
for many associated churches or neighbours to renounce
communion with him. The special pastors
of particular churches, having the government of
those churches, are the special governing judges, who
shall or shall not have communion as a member in
their churches; but the neighbour pastors of other
churches have the power of judging with whom they
and their own flocks will or will not hold communion.
As e.&nbsp;g. Athanasius may as governor of his flock declare
any Arian member excommunicate, and require
his flock to have no communion with him. And all
the neighbour pastors (though they excommunicate
not the same man as his special governors, yet) may
declare to all their flocks, that if that man come among
them, they will have no communion with him, and
that at distance they renounce that distant communion
which is proper to christians one with another,
and take him for none of the church of Christ.<span

<h3>Quest. XXV. <i>Whether canons be laws? and pastors have a legislative
power?</i></h3>

<p>All men are not agreed what a law is, that is, what
is to be taken for the proper sense of that word.
Some will have the name confined to such common
laws as are stated, durable rules for the subject's
actions: and some will extend it also to personal,
temporary, verbal precepts and mandates, such as
parents and masters use daily to the children and
servants of their families. And of the first sort, some
will confine the name laws to those acts of sovereignty
which are about the common matters of
the kingdom, or which no inferior officer may make:
and others will extend it to those orders which by
the sovereign's charter, a corporation, or college, or
school may make for the subregulation of their particular
societies and affairs.</p>

<p>I have declared my own opinion <i>de nomine</i> fully
elsewhere, 1. That the definition of a law in the proper,
general sense, is to be a sign or signification of
the reason and will of the rector as such, to his subjects
as such, instituting or antecedently determining
what shall be due from them, and to them; <i>Jus
efficiendo</i>, regularly making right.</p>

<p>2. That these laws are many more ways diversified
and distinguished, (from the efficient, sign, subjects,
matter, end, &amp;c.) than is meet for us here to enumerate.
It is sufficient now to say, 1. That stated
regular laws, as distinct from temporary mandates
and proclamations. 2. And laws for kingdoms
and other commonwealths, in regard of laws for
persons, schools, families, &amp;c. 3. And laws made
by the supreme power, as distinct from those made
by the derived authority of colleges, corporations, &amp;c.
called by-laws or orders (for I will here say nothing
of parents and pastors, whose authority is directly or
immediately from the efficiency of nature in one, and
divine institution in the other, and not derived efficiently
from the magistrate or any man). 4. That
laws about great, substantial matters, distinct from
those about little and mutable circumstances, &amp;c. I
say the first sort, as distinct from the second, are laws
so called by excellency above other laws. But that
the rest are univocally to be called laws, according
to the best definition of the law <i>in genere</i>. But
if any man will speak otherwise, let him remember
that it is yet but <i>lis de nomine</i>, and that he may use
his liberty, and I will use mine. Now to the question.</p>

<p>1. Canons made by virtue of the pastoral office
and God's general laws (in nature or Scripture) for
regulating it, are a sort of laws to the subjects or
flocks of those pastors.</p>

<p>2. Canons made by the votes of the laity of the
church, or private part of that society as private, are
no laws at all, but agreements; because they are not
acts of any governing power.</p>

<p>3. Canons made by civil rulers about the circumstantials
of the church, belonging to their office, as
orderers of such things, are laws, and may be urged
by moderate and meet civil or corporal penalties, and
no otherwise.</p>

<p>4. Canons made by princes or inferior magistrates,
are no laws purely and formally ecclesiastical, which
are essentially acts of pastoral power; but only materially
ecclesiastical, and formally magistratical.</p>

<p>5. No church officers as such, (much less the
people,) can make laws with a co-active or coercive
sanction; that is, to be enforced by their authority
with the sword or any corporal penalty, mulct, or
force; this being the sole privilege of secular powers,
civil, or economical, or scholastic.</p>

<p>6. There is no obligation ariseth to the subject for
particular obedience of any law, which is evidently
against the laws of God (in nature or holy Scripture).</p>

<p>7. They are no laws which pastors make to people
out of their power: as the popes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>8. There is no power on earth under Christ, that
hath authority to make universal laws; to bind the
whole church on all the earth; or all mankind. Because
there is no universal sovereign, civil or spiritual,
personal or collective.</p>

<p>9. Therefore it is no schism, but loyalty to Christ,
to renounce or separate from such a society of usurpation;
nor any disobedience or rebellion, to deny
them obedience.</p>

<p>10. Pastors may and must be obeyed in things
lawful as magistrates, if the king make them magistrates:
though I think it unmeet for them to accept
a magistracy with the sword, except in case of some
rare necessity.</p>

<p>11. If pope, patriarchs, or pastors shall usurp any
of the king's authority, loyalty to Christ and him,
and the love of the church and state, oblige us to
take part with Christ and the king against such
usurpation, but only by lawful means, in the compass
of our proper place and calling.</p>

<p>12. The canons made by the councils of many
churches, have a double nature: as they are made
for the people and the subjects of the pastors, they
are a sort of laws; that is, they oblige by the derived
authority of the pastors; because the pastors of
several churches do not lose any of their power by
their assembling, but exercise it with the greater
advantage of concord. But as they are made only
to oblige the present or absent pastors who separatedly
are of equal office power, so they are no laws,
except in an equivocal sense, but only agreements
or contracts.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_268" id="Ref_268" href="#Foot_268">[268]</a></span>
So Bishop Usher professed his judgment
to be; and before him the council of Carthage
in Cyprian's time; but it needs no proof, any more
than that a convention of kings may make no laws
to bind the kings of England, but contracts only.</p>

<p>13. But yet we are <i>aliunde</i> obliged even by God,
to keep these agreements in things lawful, for the
church's peace and concord, when greater contrary
reasons, <i>a fine</i>, do not disoblige us. For when God
saith, You shall keep peace and concord, and keep
lawful covenants, the canons afford us the minor,
But these are lawful contracts or agreements, and
means of the church's peace and concord; therefore
(saith God's law) you shall observe them. So
though the contracts (as of husband and wife, buyer
and seller, &amp;c.) be not laws, yet that is a law of
God which bindeth us to keep them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">{646}</a></span>
14. Seeing that even the obliging commands of
pastors may not by them be enforced by the sword,
but work by the power of divine authority or commission
manifested, and by holy reason and love,
therefore it is most modest and fit for pastors (who
must not lord it over God's heritage, but be examples to all<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_269" id="Ref_269" href="#Foot_269">[269]</a></span>)
to take the lower name of authoritative
directions and persuasions, rather than of laws;
especially in a time when papal usurpation maketh
such ruinating use of that name, and civil magistrates
use to take it in the nobler and narrower sense.</p>

<p>The questions, 1. If one pastor make orders for
his church, and the multitudes or synods be against
them; which must be obeyed, you may gather from
what is said before of ordination. And, 2. What are
the particulars proper, materially, to the magistrate's
decision, and what to the pastor's? I here pass by.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXVI. <i>Whether church canons, or pastors' directive
determinations of matters pertinent to their office, do bind the
conscience? and what accidents will disoblige the people? you may
gather before in the same case about magistrates' laws, in the
political directions: as also by an impartial transferring the case to
the precepts of parents and schoolmasters to children; without respect
to their power of the rod (or supposing that they had none such).</i></h3>

<h3>Quest. XXVII. <i>What are Christ's appointed means of the unity and
concord of the universal church, and consequently of its preservation,
if there be no human universal head and governor of it upon earth? And
if Christ have instituted none such, whether prudence and the law of
nature oblige not the church to set up and maintain a universal
ecclesiastical monarchy or aristocracy; seeing that which is every
man's work, is as no man's, and omitted by all?</i></h3>

<p>I. To the first question I must refer you in part
to two small, popular, yet satisfactory Tractates,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_270" id="Ref_270" href="#Foot_270">[270]</a></span>
written long ago, that I do not one thing too oft.
Briefly now,</p>

<p>1. The unity of the universal church, is founded in
and maintained by their common relation to Christ
the head (as the kingdom in its relation to the king).</p>

<p>2. A concord in degrees of goodness, and in integrals
and accidentals of christianity, will never be
obtained on earth, where the church is still imperfect;
and perfect holiness and wisdom are necessary
to perfect harmony and concord, Phil. iii. 12-14.</p>

<p>3. Experience hath long taught the church, if it
will learn, that the claim of a papal headship and
government over the church universal, hath been
the famous incendiary and hinderer of concord in
the christian world.</p>

<p>4. The means to attain such a measure of concord
and harmony which is to be hoped for, or endeavoured
upon earth, I have so distinctly, fully, and yet
briefly described (with the contrary impediments) in
my treatise of the "Reasons of Christian Religion,"
part vii. chap. 14. p. 470, 471, in about two leaves,
that I will not recite them. If you say, you are not
bound to read the books which I refer you to; I
answer, Nor this.</p>

<p>II. To the latter question I answer, To set up
such an universal head on the supposition of natural
reasons and human policy is, 1. To cross Christ's
institution, and the laws of the Holy Ghost, as hath
been long proved by protestants from the Scripture.</p>

<p>2. It is treason against Christ's sovereign office
to usurp such a vicegerency without his commission.</p>

<p>3. It is against the notorious light of nature, which
telleth us of the natural incapacity of mortal man,
to be such a universal governor through the world.</p>

<p>4. It is to sin against long and dreadful common
experience, and to keep in that fire that hath destroyed
emperors, kings, and kingdoms, and set the
churches, pastors, and christian world in those divisions,
which are the great and serviceable work of
Satan, and the impediment of the church's increase,
purity, and peace, and the notorious shame of the
christian profession in the eyes of the infidel world.</p>

<p>And if so many hundred years' sad experience will
not answer them that say, If the pope were a good
man, he might unite us all, I conclude that such deserve
to be deceived, 2&nbsp;Thess. ii. 10-12.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXVIII. <i>Who is the judge of controversies in the church? 1.
About the exposition of the Scripture, and doctrinal points in
themselves: 2. About either heresies or wicked practices, as they are
charged on the persons who are accused of them; that is, 1.
Antecedently to our practice, by way of regulation; 2. Or
consequently, by judicial sentence (and execution) on offenders.</i></h3>

<p>I have answered this question so oft, that I can
persuade myself to no more than this short, yet clear
solution.</p>

<p>The papists used to cheat poor, unlearned persons
that cannot justly discern things that differ, by puzzling
them with this confused, ambiguous question.
Some things they cunningly and falsely take for
granted, as that there is such a thing on earth as a
political, universal church, headed by any mortal governor.
Some things they shuffle together in equivocal
words. They confound, 1. Public judgment
of decision, and private judgment of discerning. 2.
The magistrate's judgment of church-controversies,
and the pastor's, and the several cases, and ends, and
effects of their several judgments. 3. Church-judgment
as directive to a particular church, and as a
means of the concord of several churches. Which
being but distinguished, a few words will serve to
clear the difficulty.</p>

<p>1. As there is no universal human church, (constituted
or governed by a mortal head,) so there is no
power set up by Christ to be a universal judge of
either sort of controversies, by decisive judicial sentence,
nor any universal civil monarch of the world.</p>

<p>2. The public, governing, decisive judgment, obliging
others, belongeth to public persons, or officers
of God, and not to any private man.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_271" id="Ref_271" href="#Foot_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The public decision of doubts or controversies
about faith itself, or the true sense of God's word
and laws, as obliging the whole church on earth to
believe that decision, or not gainsay it, because of
the infallibility or governing authority of the deciders,
belongeth to none but Jesus Christ; because,
as is said, he hath made no universal governor, nor
infallible expositor.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_272" id="Ref_272" href="#Foot_272">[272]</a></span>
It belongeth to the lawgiver
only to make such a universally obliging exposition
of his own laws.</p>

<p>4. True bishops or pastors in their own particular
churches are authorized teachers and guides, in expounding
the laws and word of Christ; and the people
are bound as learners to reverence their teaching,
and not contradict it without true cause; yea, and to
believe them <i>fide humana</i>, in things pertinent to their
office: for <i>oportet discentem credere</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">{647}</a></span>
5. No such pastors are to be absolutely believed,
nor in any case of notorious error or heresy, where
the word of God is discerned to be against them.</p>

<p>6. For all the people as reasonable creatures, have
a judgment of private discerning to judge what they
must receive as truth, and to discern their own duty,
by the help of the word of God, and of their teachers.</p>

<p>7. The same power of governing judgment lawful
synods have over their several flocks, as a pastor
over his own, but with greater advantage.</p>

<p>8. The power of judging in many consociate
churches, who is to be taken into communion as orthodox,
and who to be refused by those churches as
heretics, <i>in specie</i>, that is, what doctrine they will
judge sound or unsound, as it is <i>judicium discernendi</i>,
belongeth to every one of the council singly: as it
is a judgment obliging themselves by contract, (and
not of governing each other,) it is in the contracters
and consenters; and for peace and order usually in
the major vote; but with the limitations before expressed.</p>

<p>9. Every true christian believeth all the essentials
of christianity, with a divine faith, and not by a mere
human belief of his teachers, though by their help
and teaching his faith is generated, and confirmed,
and preserved. Therefore no essential article of
christianity is left to any obliging decision of any
church, but only to a subservient obliging teaching:
as whether there be a God, a Christ, a heaven, a
hell, an immortality of souls? Whether God be to be
believed, loved, feared, obeyed before man? Whether
the Scripture be God's word, and true? Whether
those that contradict it are to be believed therein?
Whether pastors, assemblies, public worship, baptism,
sacrament of the Lord's supper, be divine institutions?
And the same I may say of any known
word of God: no mortals may judge in <i>partem utramlibet</i>,
but the pastors are only authorized teachers
and helpers of the people's faith. (And so they be
partly to one another.)</p>

<p>10. If the pope, or his council, were the infallible
or the governing expositors of all God's laws and
Scriptures, 1. God would have enabled them to do it
by a universal commentary which all men should
be obliged to believe, or at least not to contradict.
For there is no authority and obligation given to
men (yea, to so many successively) to do that (for
the needful decision of controversies) which they
never have ability given them to do. For that were
to oblige them to things impossible. 2. And the
pope and his council would be the most treacherous
miscreants on earth, that in so many hundred years,
would never write such an infallible nor governing
commentary, to end the differences of the christian
world. Indeed they have judged (with others)
against Arius, that Christ is true God, and one with
the Father in substance, &amp;c. But if they had said
the contrary, must we have taken it for God's truth,
or have believed them?</p>

<p>11. To judge who, for heresy or scandal, shall be
punished by the sword, belongeth to none but the
magistrate in his own dominions: as to judge who
shall have communion or be excommunicated from
the church, belongeth, as aforesaid, to the pastors.
And the said magistrate hath first as a man his own
judgment of discerning what is heresy, and who of
his subjects are guilty of it, in order to his public
governing judgment.</p>

<p>12. The civil, supreme ruler may antecedently exercise
this judgment of discerning (by the teaching
of their proper teachers) in order to his consequent
sentences on offenders; and so in his laws may tell
the subjects, what doctrines and practices he will
either tolerate or punish. And thus may the church
pastors do in their canons to their several flocks, in
relation to communion or non-communion.</p>

<p>13. He that will condemn particular persons as
heretics or offenders, must allow them to speak for
themselves, and hear the proofs, and give them that
which justice requireth, &amp;c. And if the pope can
do so at the antipodes, and in all the world, either
<i>per se</i>, or <i>per alium</i>, without giving that other his
essential claimed power, let him prove it by better
experience than we have had.</p>

<p>14. As the prime and sole universal legislation
belongeth to Jesus Christ, so the final judgment,
universal and particular, belongeth to him, which
only will end all controversies, and from which there
is no appeal.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXIX. <i>Whether a parent's power over his children, or a
pastor or many pastors or bishops over the same children, as parts of
their flock, be greater, or more obliging in matters of religion and
public worship?</i></h3>

<p>This being touched on somewhere else, I only
now say, That if the case were my own, I would,
1. Labour to know their different powers, as to the
matter commanded, and obey each in that which is
proper to its place.</p>

<p>2. If I were young and ignorant, natural necessity,
and natural obligation together, would give my
parents with whom I lived such an advantage above
the minister (whom I seldom see or understand) as
would determine the case <i>de eventu</i>, and much <i>de jure</i>.</p>

<p>3. If my parents command me to hear a teacher
who is against ceremonies or certain forms, and to
hear none that are for them, natural necessity here
also (ordinarily) would make it my duty first to hear
and obey my parents; and in many other cases, till
I came to understand the greater power of the pastors,
in their own place and work.</p>

<p>4. But when I come to church, or know that the
judgment of all concordant godly pastors condemneth
such a thing as damnable heresy or sin, which
my father commandeth me to receive and profess, I
would more believe and follow the judgment of the
pastors and churches.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXX. <i>May an office teacher or pastor be at once in a stated
relation of a pastor and a disciple to some other pastor?</i></h3>

<p>1. That Timothy was still Paul's son in point of
learning, and his disciple, and so that under apostles
the same persons might be stated in both relations
at once, seemeth evident in Scripture.</p>

<p>2. But the same that is a pastor is not at once a
mere layman.</p>

<p>3. That men in the same office may so differ in
age, experience, and degrees of knowledge, as that
young pastors may, and often ought, many years to
continue, not only in occasional reception of their
help, but also in an ordinary stated way of receiving
it, and so be related to them as their ordinary
teachers, by such gradual advantages, is past all
doubt. And that all juniors and novices owe a certain
reverence and audience, and some obedience, to
the elder and wiser.</p>

<p>4. But this is not to be a disciple to him as in
lower order or office, but as of lower gifts and grace.</p>

<p>5. It is lawful and very good for the church, that
some ordained persons continue long as pupils to
their tutors in schools or academies (e.&nbsp;g. to learn
the holy languages, if they have them not, &amp;c.)
But this is a relation left to voluntary contractors.</p>

<p>6. In the ancient churches the particular churches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">{648}</a></span>
had one bishop, and some presbyters and deacons,
usually of much lower parts, who lived all together
(single or chaste) in the bishop's or church house,
which was as a college, where he daily edified them
by doctrine and example.</p>

<p>7. The controversy about different orders by divine
institution, belongeth not to me here to meddle
with: but as to the natural and acquired imparity of
age and gifts, and the unspeakable benefit to the
juniors and the churches, that it is desirable that
there were such a way of their education and edification,
I take to be discernible to any that are impartial
and judicious.</p>

<p>Ambrose was at once a teacher and a learner,
Beda, Eccl. Hist. mentioneth one in England, that
was at once a pastor and disciple. And in Scotland
some that became bishops were still to be under the
government of the abbot of their monasteries according
to their first devotion, though the abbot was but
a presbyter.</p>

<p>8. Whether a settled, private church member may
not at once continue his very formal relation to the
pastor of that church, and yet be of the same order
with him in another church, as their pastor, at the
same time, (as he may in case of necessity continue
his apprenticeship or civil service,) is a case that I
will not determine. But he that denieth it, must
prove his opinion (or affirmation of its unlawfulness)
by sufficient evidence from Scripture or nature;
which is hard.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXI. <i>Who hath the power of making church canons?</i></h3>

<p>This is sufficiently resolved before. 1. The magistrate
only hath the power of making such canons or
laws for church matters as shall be enforced by the
sword.</p>

<p>2. Every pastor hath power to make canons for
his own congregation; that is, to determine what
hour or at what place they shall meet; what translation
of Scripture, or version of Psalms, shall be
used in his church; what chapter shall be read;
what psalm shall be sung, &amp;c.: except the magistrate
contradict him, and determine it otherwise, in
such points as are not proper to the ministerial office.</p>

<p>3. Councils or assemblies of pastors have the
power of making such canons for many churches, as
shall be laws to the people, and agreements to themselves.</p>

<p>4. None have power to make church laws or
canons about any thing, save, (1.) To put God's
own laws in execution. (2.) To determine to that
end, of such circumstances as God hath left undetermined
in his word.</p>

<p>5. Canon-making under pretence of order and concord,
hath done a great deal of mischief to the
churches; whilst clergymen have grown up from
agreements, to tyrannical usurpations and impositions,
and from concord about needful accidents of
worship, to frame new worship ordinances, and to
force them on all others: but especially, (1.) By encroaching
on the power of kings, and telling them
that they are bound in conscience to put all their
canons into execution by force. (2.) And by laying
the union of the churches and the communion of
christians upon things needless and doubtful, yea,
and at last on many sinful things; whereby the
churches have been most effectually divided, and the
christian world set together by the ears; and
schisms, yea, and wars have been raised: and these
maladies cannot possibly be healed, till the tormenting,
tearing engines be broken and cast away, and
the voluminous canons of numerous councils (which
themselves also are matter of undeterminable controversy)
be turned into the primitive simplicity; and
a few necessary things made the terms of concord.
Doubtless if every pastor were left wholly to himself
for the ordering of worship circumstances and
accidents in his own church, without any common
canons, save the Scriptures, and the laws of the land,
there would have been much less division, than that
is, which these numerous canons of all the councils,
obtruded on the church, have made.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXII. <i>Doth baptism as such enter the baptized into the
universal church, or into a particular church, or both? And is baptism
the particular church covenant as such?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Baptism as such doth enter us into the
universal church, and into it alone; and is no particular
church covenant, but the solemnizing of the
great christian covenant of grace, between God, and
a believer and his seed.</p>

<p>For, (1.) There is not essentially any mention of
a particular church in it.</p>

<p>(2.) A man may be baptized by a general unfixed
minister, who is not the pastor of any particular
church:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_273" id="Ref_273" href="#Foot_273">[273]</a></span>
and he may be baptized in solitude, where
there is no particular church. The eunuch, Acts
viii. was not baptized into any particular church.</p>

<p>(3.) Baptism doth but make us christians, but a
man may be a christian who is no member of any
particular church.</p>

<p>(4.) Otherwise baptism should oblige us necessarily
to a man, and be a covenant between the baptized
and the pastor and church into which he is baptized:
but it is only our covenant with Christ.</p>

<p>(5.) We may frequently change our particular
church relation, without being baptized again. But
we never change our relation to the church which
we are baptized into, unless by apostasy.</p>

<p>2. Yet the same person at the same time that he
is baptized may be entered into the universal church,
and into a particular; and ordinarily it ought to be
so where it can be had.</p>

<p>3. And the covenant which we make in baptism
with Christ, doth oblige us to obey him, and consequently
to use his instituted means, and so to hear
his ministers, and hold due communion with his
churches.</p>

<p>4. But this doth no more enter us into a particular
church, than into a particular family. For we as
well oblige ourselves to obey him in family relations
as in church relations.</p>

<p>5. When the baptized therefore is at once entered
into the universal and particular church, it is done
by a double consent to the double relation. By
baptism he professeth his consent to be a member of
Christ and his universal church; and additionally
he consenteth to be guided by that particular pastor
in that particular church; which is another covenant
or consent.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXIII. <i>Whether infants should be baptized, I have answered
long ago in a treatise on that subject. Also what infants should be
baptized? and who have right to sacraments? and whether hypocrites are
univocally or equivocally christians and church members? I have
resolved in my "Disput. of Right to Sacraments."</i></h3>

<h3>Quest. XXXIV. <i>Whether an unbaptized person who yet maketh a public
profession of christianity, be a member of the visible church? And so
of the infants of believers unbaptized.</i></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">{649}</a></span>
<i>Answ.</i> 1. Such persons have a certain imperfect,
irregular kind of profession, and so of membership;
their visibility or visible christianity is not such as
Christ hath appointed. As those that are married,
but not by legal celebration, and as those that in
cases of necessity are ministers without ordination;
so are such christians as Constantine and many of
old without baptism.</p>

<p>2. Such persons ordinarily are not to be admitted
to the rights and communion of the visible church,
because we must know Christ's sheep by his own
mark; but yet they are so far visible christians, as
that we may be persuaded nevertheless of their salvation.
As to visible communion, they have but a
remote and incomplete <i>jus ad rem</i>, and no <i>jus ad re</i>,
or legal investiture and possession.</p>

<p>3. The same is the case of unbaptized infants of
believers, because they are not of the church merely
as they are their natural seed; but because it is supposed
that a person himself devoted to God, doth
also devote his children to God: therefore not nature
only, but this supposition arising from the true nature
of his own dedication to God, is the reason why
believers' children have their right to baptism:
therefore till he hath actually devoted them to God
in baptism, they are not legally members of the visible
church, but only in <i>fieri</i> and imperfectly, as is

<h3>Quest. XXXV. <i>Is it certain by the word of God that all infants
baptized, and dying before actual sin, are undoubtedly saved; or what
infants may we say so of?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I. 1. We must distinguish between certainty
objective and subjective; or plainlier, the reality or
truth of the thing, and the certain apprehension of it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_274" id="Ref_274" href="#Foot_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>2. And this certainty of apprehension, sometimes
signifieth only the truth of that apprehension, when
a man indeed is not deceived, or more usually that
clearness of apprehension joined with truth, which
fully quieteth the mind and excludeth doubting.</p>

<p>3. We must distinguish of infants as baptized lawfully
upon just title, or unlawfully without title.</p>

<p>4. And also of title before God, which maketh a
lawful claim and reception at his bar; and title before
the church, which maketh only the administration
lawful before God, and the reception lawful only
<i>in foro ecclesia</i>, or <i>externo</i>.</p>

<p>5. The word baptism signifieth either the external
part only, consisting in the words and outward action,
or the internal covenanting of the heart also.</p>

<p>6. And that internal covenant is either sincere,
which giveth right to the benefits of God's covenant,
or only partial, reserved, and unsound, such as is
common to hypocrites.</p>

<p><i>Conclus.</i> 1. God hath been pleased to speak so
little in Scripture of the case of infants, that modest
men will use the words certainly and undoubtedly,
about their case, with very great caution. And many
great divines have maintained that their very baptism
itself, cannot be certainly and undoubtedly
proved by the word of God, but by tradition; though
I have endeavoured to prove the contrary in a special
Treatise on that point.</p>

<p>2. No man can tell what is objectively certain or
revealed in God's word, who hath not subjective certainty
or knowledge of it.</p>

<p>3. A man's apprehension may be true, when it is
but a wavering opinion, with the greatest doubtfulness.
Therefore we do not usually by a certain apprehension,
mean only a true apprehension, but a
clear and quieting one.</p>

<p>4. It is possible to baptize infants unlawfully, or
without any right, so that their reception and baptizing
shall be a great sin, as is the misapplying of
other ordinances. For instance: one in America,
where there is neither church to receive them, nor
christian parents, nor sponsors, may take up the Indians'
children and baptize them against the parents'
wills: or if the parents consent to have their children
outwardly baptized, and not themselves, as not
knowing what baptizing meaneth, or desire it only
for outward advantages to their children; or if they
offer them to be baptized only in open derision and
scorn of Christ; such children have no right to be
received. And many other instances nearer may be
given.</p>

<p>5. It is possible the person may have no authority
at all from Christ who doth baptize them. And
Christ's part in reception of the person, and collation
and investiture in his benefits, must be done by his
commission, or else how can we say that Christ doth
it? But open infidels, women, children, mad-men,
scorners, may do it that have none of his commission.</p>

<p>6. That all infants baptized without title or right
by misapplication, and so dying, are not undoubtedly
saved, nor any word of God doth certainly say so,
we have reason to believe on these following grounds.</p>

<p>1. Because we can find no such text, nor could
ever prevail with them that say so, to show us such
an ascertaining word of God.</p>

<p>2. Because else gross sin would certainly be the
way to salvation. For such misapplication of baptism,
by the demanders at least, would certainly be
gross sin, as well as misapplying the Lord's supper.</p>

<p>3. Because it is clean contrary to the tenor of the
new covenant, which promiseth salvation to none but
penitent believers and their seed: what God may do
for others unknown to us, we have nothing to do
with; but his covenant hath made no other promise
that I can find; and we are certain of no man's salvation
by baptism, to whom God never made a promise
of it. If by the children of the faithful, be
meant not only their natural seed, but the adopted or
bought also, of which they are true proprietors, yet
that is nothing to all others.</p>

<p>4. To add to God's words, especially to his very
promise or covenant, is so terrible a presumption,
as we dare not be guilty of.</p>

<p>5. Because this tieth grace or salvation so to the
outward washing of the body, or <i>opus operatum</i>, as
is contrary to the nature of God's ordinances, and to
the tenor of Scripture, and the judgment of the
protestant divines.</p>

<p>6. Because this would make a strange disparity
between the two sacraments of the same covenant of
grace: when a man receiveth the Lord's supper
unworthily, (in scorn, in drunkenness, or impenitency,)
much more without any right, (as infidels,) he doth
eat and drink damnation or judgment to himself, and
maketh his sin greater; therefore he that gets a child
baptized unworthily and without right, doth not
therefore infallibly procure his salvation.</p>

<p>7. Because the apostle saith, 1&nbsp;Cor. vii. 14, "Else
were your children unclean, but now are they holy;"
and the Scripture giveth this privilege to the children
of the faithful above others: whereas the contrary
opinion levelleth them with the seed of infidels and
heathens, as if these had right to salvation by mere
baptism, as well as the others.</p>

<p>8. Because else it would be the greatest act of
charity in the world, to send soldiers to catch up all
heathens' and infidels' children, and baptize them;
which no christians ever yet thought their duty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">{650}</a></span>
Yea, it would be too strong a temptation to them to
kill them when they had done, that they might be
all undoubtedly saved.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But that were to do evil that good might
come by it. <i>Answ.</i> But God is not to be dishonoured
as to be supposed to make such laws, as shall forbid
men the greatest good in the world, and then to
tempt them by the greatness of the benefit to take
it to be no evil: as if he said, If soldiers would go
take up a million of heathens' children and baptize
them, it will put them into an undoubted state of
salvation; but yet I forbid them doing it: and if
they presently kill them, lest they sin after, they
shall undoubtedly be saved; but yet I forbid them
doing it. I need not aggravate this temptation to
them that know the power of the law of nature,
which is the law of love and good works, and how
God that is most good is pleased in our doing good.
Though he tried Abraham's obedience once, as if he
should have killed his son, yet he stopped him before
the execution. And doth he ordinarily exercise
men's obedience, by forbidding them to save the
souls of others, when it is easily in their power?
especially when with the adult the greatest labour
and powerfullest preaching, is frequently so frustrate,
that not one of many is converted by it?</p>

<p>9. Because else God should deal with unaccountable
disparity with infants and the adult in the same
ordinance of baptism. It is certain that all adult
persons baptized, if they died immediately, should
not be saved; even none that had no right to the
covenant and to baptism; such as infidels, heathens,
impenitent persons, hypocrites, that have not true
repentance and faith. And why should baptism
save an infant without title, any more than the adult
without title? I still suppose that some infants have
no title, and that now I speak of them alone.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the church giveth them all right by
receiving them.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This is to be further examined anon. If
you mean a particular church, perhaps they are baptized
into none such. Baptism as such is a reception
only into the universal church, as in the eunuch's
case, Acts viii. appeareth. If you mean the universal
church, it may be but one single ignorant man in an
infidel country that baptizeth, and he is not the
universal church! yea, perhaps is not a lawfully
called minister of that church! However, this is but
to say, that baptism giveth right to baptism; for
this receiving is nothing but baptizing. But there
must be a right to this reception, if baptism be a
distinguishing ordinance, and all the world have not
right to it. Christ saith, Matt. xxviii. 19, "Disciple
me all nations, baptizing them&mdash;:" they must be
initially made disciples first, by consent, and then
be invested in the visible state of christianity by
baptism.</p>

<p>10. If the children of heathens have right to
baptism, and salvation thereby, it is either, 1. As
they are men, and all have right; or, 2. Because the
parents give them right; 3. Or because remote ancestors
give them right; 4. Or because the universal
church gives them right; 5. Or because a particular
church gives them right; 6. Or because the sponsors
give them right; 7. Or the magistrate; 8. Or the
baptizer. But it is none of all these, as shall anon
be proved.</p>

<p>11. But as to the second question, I answer, 1. It
will help us to understand the case the better, if we
prepare the way by opening the case of the adult,
because in Scripture times, they were the most
famous subjects of baptism. And it is certain of such,
1. That every one outwardly baptized is not in a state
of salvation. That no hypocrite that is not a true penitent
believer is in such a state. 2. That every true
penitent believer is before God in a state of salvation,
as soon as he is such; and before the church as soon
as he is baptized. 3. That we are not to use the
word baptism as a physical term only, but as a moral,
theological term. Because words (as in law, physic,
&amp;c.) are to be understood according to the art or
science in which they are treated of. And baptism
taken theologically doth as essentially include the
will's consent or heart covenanting with God, as
matrimony includeth marriage consent, and as a
man containeth the soul as well as the body. And
thus it is certain that all truly baptized persons are
in a state of salvation; that is, all that sincerely
consent to the baptismal covenant when they profess
consent by baptism (but not hypocrites). 4. And in
this sense all the ancient pastors of the churches
did concur that baptism did wash away all sin, and
put the baptized into a present right to life eternal:
as he that examineth their writings will perceive:
not the outward washing and words alone, but when
the inward and outward parts concur, or when by
true faith and repentance the receiver hath right to
the covenant of God. 5. In this sense it is no unfit
language to imitate the fathers, and to say that the
truly baptized are in a state of justification, adoption,
and salvation, unless when men's misunderstanding
maketh it unsafe. 6. The sober papists
themselves say the same thing, and when they have
said that even <i>ex opere operato</i> baptism saveth, they
add, that it is only the meet receiver; that is, the
penitent believer, and no other of the adult. So
that hitherto there is no difference.</p>

<p>2. Now let us by this try the case of infants; concerning
which there are all these several opinions
among divines.</p>

<p>(1.) Some think that all infants (baptized or not)
are saved from hell, and positive punishment, but are
not brought to heaven, as being not capable of
such joys.</p>

<p>(2.) Some think that all infants (dying such) are
saved as others are, by actual felicity in heaven,
though in a lower degree. Both these sorts suppose
that Christ's death saveth all that reject it not, and
that infants reject it not.</p>

<p>(3.) Some think that all unbaptized infants do
suffer the <i>pœnam damni</i>, and are shut out of heaven
and happiness, but not sensibly punished or cast into
hell. For this Jansenius hath wrote a treatise; and
many other papists think so.</p>

<p>(4.) Some think that all the children of sincere
believers dying in infancy are saved, (that is, glorified,)
whether baptized or not; and no others.</p>

<p>(5.) Some think that God hath not at all revealed
what he will do with any infants.</p>

<p>(6.) Some think that he hath promised salvation
as aforesaid to believers and their seed, but hath not
at all revealed to us what he will do with all the rest.</p>

<p>(7.) Some think that only the baptized children
of true believers are certainly (by promise) saved.</p>

<p>(8.) Some think that all the adopted and bought
children of true christians, as well as the natural, are
saved (if baptized, say some; or if not, say others).</p>

<p>(9.) Some think that elect infants are saved, and
no other, but no man can know who those are. And
of these, 1. Some deny infant baptism. 2. Most say
that they are to be baptized, and that thereby the
non-elect are only received into the visible church
and its privileges, but not to any promise or certainty
of justification, or a state of salvation.</p>

<p>(10.) Some think that all that are baptized by the
dedication of christian sponsors are saved.</p>

<p>(11.) Some think that all that the pastor dedicateth
to God are saved (because so dedicated by him, say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">{651}</a></span>
some; or because baptized <i>ex opere operato</i>, say
others). And so all baptized infants are in a state of
salvation.</p>

<p>(12.) Some think that this is to be limited to all
that have right to baptism <i>coram Deo</i>; which some
think the church's reception giveth them, of which
anon.</p>

<p>(13.) And some think it is to be limited to those
that have right <i>coram ecclesia</i>, or are rightfully
baptized <i>ex parte ministrantis</i>, where some make
the magistrate's command sufficient, and some the
bishop's, and some the baptizer's will.</p>

<p>Of the title to baptism I shall speak anon. Of
the salvation of infants, it is too tedious to confute
all that I dissent from: not presuming in such darkness
and diversity of opinions to be peremptory, nor
to say, I am certain by the word of God who are undoubtedly
saved, nor yet to deny the undoubted certainty
of wiser men, who may know that which such
as I do doubt of, but submitting what I say to the
judgment of the church of God and my superiors, I
humbly lay down my own thoughts as followeth.</p>

<p>1. I think that there can no promise or proof be
produced that all unbaptized infants are saved, either
from the <i>pœna damni</i> or <i>sensus</i>, or both.</p>

<p>2. I think that no man can prove that all unbaptized
infants are damned, or denied heaven. Nay, I
think I can prove a promise of the contrary.</p>

<p>3. All that are rightfully baptized <i>in foro externo</i>
are visible church members, and have ecclesiastical
right to the privileges of the visible church.</p>

<p>4. I think Christ never instituted baptism for
collation of these outward privileges alone, unless as
on supposition that persons culpably fail of the better
ends.</p>

<p>5. I think baptism is a solemn mutual contract or
covenant between Christ and the baptized person.
And that it is but one covenant, even the covenant
of grace which is the sum of the gospel, which is
sealed and received in baptism; and that this covenant
essentially containeth our saving relation to
God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and our pardon,
justification, and adoption or right to life everlasting;
and that God never made any distinct covenant
of outward privileges alone, to be sealed by
baptism. But that outward mercies are the second
and lesser gift of the same covenant which giveth
first the great and saving blessings.</p>

<p>6. And therefore that whoever hath right before
God, to claim and receive baptism, hath right also to
the benefits of the covenant of God, and that is, to
salvation; though I say not so of every one that hath
such right before the church, as that God doth require
the minister to baptize him. For by right
before God, or <i>in foro cœli</i>, I mean such a right as
will justify the claim before God immediately, the
person being one whom he commandeth in that present
state to claim and receive baptism. For many
a one hath no such right before God to claim or receive
it, when yet the minister hath right to give it
them if they do claim it.</p>

<p>The case stands thus. God saith in his covenant,
He that believeth shall be saved, and ought to be
baptized, to profess that belief, and be invested in
the benefits of the covenant; and he that professeth
to believe, (whether he do or not,) is by the church
to be taken for a visible believer, and by baptism to
be received into the visible church. Here God
calleth none but true believers (and their seed) to
be baptized, nor maketh an actual promise or covenant
with any other; and so I say that none other
have right <i>in foro cœli</i>. But yet the church knoweth
not men's hearts, and must take a serious profession
for a credible sign of the faith professed, and for that
outward title upon which it is a duty of the pastor to
baptize the claimer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_275" id="Ref_275" href="#Foot_275">[275]</a></span>
So that the most malignant,
scornful hypocrite, that maketh a seemingly serious
profession, hath right <i>coram ecclesia</i>, but not <i>coram
Deo</i>, save in this sense, that God would have the
minister baptize him. But this I have largelier
opened in my "Disputations of Right to Sacraments."</p>

<p>7. I think therefore that all the children of true
christians, do by baptism receive a public investiture
by God's appointment into a state of remission,
adoption, and right to salvation at the present;
though I dare not say that I am undoubtedly certain of
it, as knowing how much is said against it. But I
say as the synod of Dort, art. 1. That believing parents
have no cause to doubt of the salvation of their
children that die in infancy, before they commit
actual sin; that is, not to trouble themselves with
fears about it.</p>

<p>The reasons that move me to be of this judgment
(though not without doubting and hesitancy) are
these; 1. Because whoever hath right to the present
investiture, delivery, and possession of the first and
great benefits of God's covenant made with man in
baptism, hath right to pardon, and adoption, and
everlasting life: but the infants of true christians
have right to the present investiture, delivery and
possession of the first and great benefits of God's
covenant made with man in baptism; therefore
they have right to pardon and everlasting life.</p>

<p>Either infants are in the same covenant (that is,
are subjects of the same promise of God) with their
believing parents, or in some other covenant, or in
no covenant. If they be under no covenant, (or promise,)
or under some other promise or covenant
only, and not the same, they are not to be baptized.
For baptism is a mutual covenanting; where the
minister by Christ's commission in his name acteth
his part, and the believer his own and his infant's
part: and God hath but one covenant, which is to
be made, sealed, and delivered in baptism. Baptism
is not an equivocal word, so as to signify divers
covenants of God.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the same covenant of God hath divers
sorts of benefits; the special God giveth to the sincere,
and the common to the common and hypocritical
receiver.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. God indeed requireth the minister to
take profession for the visible church title; and so
it being the minister's duty so far to believe a liar,
and to receive dissemblers who had no right to lay
that claim, you may say that God indirectly and improperly
giveth them church privileges: but properly,
that is, by his promise or covenant deed or
gift, he giveth them nothing at all; for his covenant
is one and undivided in its action, though it give
several benefits, and though providence may give
one and not another, yet the covenant giveth all or
none. God saith that godliness hath the promise
of this life and of that to come; but he never
said (that I know of) to the hypocrite or unsound
believer, I promise or give right to common
mercies.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_276" id="Ref_276" href="#Foot_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But suppose it were otherwise, yet either the
children of true believers have the true condition of
right to the special blessings of the covenant, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">{652}</a></span>
they have not the condition of any at all. For there
can no more be required of an infant, as to any special
blessings of the covenant, than that he be the child
of believing parents, and by them dedicated to God.
Either this condition entitleth them to all the covenant
promises which the adult believer is entitled to,
(as far as their natures are capable,) or it entitleth
them to none at all; nor are they to be baptized;
for God hath in Scripture instituted but one baptism,
(to profess one faith,) and that one is ever for the remission
of sins:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_277" id="Ref_277" href="#Foot_277">[277]</a></span>
"He that believeth and is baptized
shall be saved," Mark xvi. 16.</p>

<p>3. Or if all the rest were granted you, yet it would
follow that all infants in the world, even of true believers,
are left out of God's covenant of grace, that
is, the covenant or promise of pardon and life; and
are only taken into the covenant of church privileges.
And so, 1. You will make two covenants, (which
you denied,) and not only two sorts of benefits of
one covenant. 2. And two species of baptism; while
all infants in the world are only under a covenant of
outward privileges, and have no baptism, but the
seal of that covenant, while believers have the covenant,
promise, and seal of pardon and life.</p>

<p>2. And this is my second reason; because then
we have no promise or certainty, or ground of faith,
for the pardon and salvation of any individual infants
in the world. And so parents are left to little
comfort for their children. And if there be no promise
there is no faith of it, nor any baptism to seal
it; and so we still make antipædobaptism unavoidable.
For who dare set God's seal to such as have
no promise? or pretend to invest any in a near and
saving relation to God the Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, (which is the very nature of baptism,) when
God hath given no such commission?</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Yes: baptism and the covenant of special
promises are for all the elect, though we know not
who they are.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. I deny not God's eternal, antecedent
election; but I deny that the Scripture ever mentioneth
his pardoning or glorifying any, upon the
account of election only, without certain spiritual
conditions, which may be given as the reason of the
difference in judgment. God may freely give the
gospel to whom he will, and also faith or the first
grace by the gospel, without any previous condition in
man, but according to his free election only: but he
giveth pardon and heaven as a rector by his equal
laws and judgment; and always rendereth a reason
of the difference, from the qualifications of man.</p>

<p>2. And if this were as you say, it would still overthrow
infant baptism. For either we must baptize
all indifferently, or none, or else know how to make
a difference. All must not be baptized indifferently:
and election is a secret thing to us, and by it no
minister in the world can tell whom to baptize:
therefore he must baptize none, if there be no other
differencing note to know them by.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> God hath more elect ones among the infants
of true believers than among others: and therefore
they are all to be baptized.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It will be hard to prove that much (that
he hath more) if there be no promise to them all as
such. 2. If he have more, yet no man knoweth
how many, and whether the elect be one of ten,
twenty, forty, or a hundred, in comparison of the
non-elect; for Scripture tells it not. So that no
minister of a church is sure that any one infant that
he ever baptized is elect. 3. And God hath given
no such rule for sealing and delivering his covenant
with the benefits as to cast it hap hazard among all,
because it is possible or probable it may belong to
some.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> You have no certainty what adult professor
is sincere, nor to which of them the special benefits
belong; no, not of any one in a church. And yet
because there is a probability that among many there
are some sincere, you baptize them all. Take then
the birth privilege but as equal to the profession of
the adult.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This partly satisfied me sometimes: but I
cannot forget that a visible, false, or hypocritical
profession is not the condition of God's own covenant
of grace, nor that which he requireth in us, to make
us partakers of his covenant benefits; nay, he never
at all commandeth it; but only commandeth that profession
of consent, which followeth the real consent
of the heart:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_278" id="Ref_278" href="#Foot_278">[278]</a></span>
he that condemneth lying, maketh it
neither the condition of our church membership, as
his gift by promise, nor yet our duty.</p>

<p>And mark well, that it is a professed consent to
the whole covenant that God requireth, as the condition
of our true right to any part or benefit of it.
He that shall only say, I consent to be a visible
church member, doth thereby acquire no right to
that membership; no, not <i>in foro ecclesiæ</i>, but he
must also profess that he consenteth to have God
for his God, and Christ for his Lord and Saviour,
and the Holy Spirit for his Sanctifier. So that he
must be a liar, or a sound believer, that maketh this
profession.</p>

<p>But for an infant to be born of true believers, and
sincerely by them dedicated in covenant to God, is
all the condition that ever God required to an infant-title
to his covenant; and it is not the failure of
the true condition as a false profession is.</p>

<p>Indeed if the proposition were thus laid, it would
hold good: As we know not who sincerely covenanteth
for himself, and yet we must baptize all that
soberly profess it; so we know not who doth sincerely
covenant for his infant, and yet must baptize
all whom the parents bring with such a profession,
for themselves and them.</p>

<p>But if the sincere dedication of a sound believer,
shall be accounted but equal to the lying profession
of the adult, which is neither commanded, nor hath
any promise, then infants are not in the covenant of
grace, nor is the sincerest dedication to God either
commanded or hath any promise.</p>

<p>If I were but sure that the profession of the adult
for himself were sincere, I were sure that he were
in a state of grace. And if I am not sure of the
same concerning the parent's dedication of his infant,
I must conclude that this is not a condition of
the same covenant, and therefore that he is not in
the same covenant (or conditional promise of God)
unless there be some other condition required in
him or for him; but there is no other that can be
devised.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Election is the condition.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Election is God's act and not man's; and
therefore may be an antecedent, but no condition
required of us. And man is not called to make
profession that he is elected, as he is to make profession
of his faith and consent to the covenant.
And God only knoweth who are his by election, and
therefore God only can baptize on this account.</p>

<p>And what is the probability which the objecters
mean, that many of the infants of the faithful are
elected? Either it is a promise, or but a prediction;
if no promise, it is not to be sealed by baptism;
if a promise, it is absolute or conditional. If
any absolute promise, as, I will save many children
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">{653}</a></span>
of believers, 1. This terminateth not on any singular
person, as baptism doth, and, 2. It is not the absolute
promise that baptism is appointed by Christ
to seal. This is apparent in Mark xvi. 16, and in
the case of the adult. And it is not one covenant
which is sealed to the adult by baptism, and another
to infants. Else baptism also should not be the
same. But if it be any conditional covenant, what
is it, and what is the condition?</p>

<p>And what is it that baptism giveth to the seed of
believers, if they be not justified by it from original
sin? You will not say, that it conveyeth inherent
sanctifying grace, no not into all the elect themselves,
which many are many years after without.
And you cannot say, that it sealeth to them any
promise, so much as of visible church privileges;
for God may suffer them presently to be made janizaries,
and violently taken from their parents, and
become strangers and despisers of church privileges,
as is ordinary with the Greek's children among the
Turks. Now God either promised such church privileges
absolutely, or conditionally, or not at all.
Not absolutely, for then they would possess them.
If conditionally, what is the condition? If not at
all, what promise then doth baptism seal to such,
and what benefit doth it secure? God hath instituted
no baptism, which is a mere present delivery
of possession of a church state, without sealing any
promise at all. True baptism first sealeth the
promise, and then delivereth possession of some
benefits.</p>

<p>Yea, indeed outward church privileges are such
uncertain blessings of the promise, that as they are
but secondary, so they are but secondarily given
and sealed, so that no man should ever be baptized,
if these were all that were in the promise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_279" id="Ref_279" href="#Foot_279">[279]</a></span>
The
holiest person may be cast into a wilderness, and deprived
of all visible church communion; and doth
God then break his promise with him? Certainly
no. It is therefore our saving relations to God the
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which the promise
giveth, and baptism sealeth; and other things but
subordinately and uncertainly as they are means to
these. So then it is plain, that believers' infants
have a promise of salvation, or no promise at all,
which baptism was instituted to seal.</p>

<p>I have said so much more of this in my Appendix
to the "Treatise of Infant Baptism," to Mr. Bedford,
in defence of Dr. Davenant's judgment, as that I must
refer the reader thither.</p>

<p>8. I think it very probable that this ascertaining
promise belongeth not only to the natural seed
of believers, but to all whom they have a true power
and right to dedicate in covenant to God; which
seemeth to be all that are properly their own, whether
adopted or bought; but there is more darkness
and doubt about this than the former, because the
Scripture hath said less of it.</p>

<p>9. I am not able to prove, nor see any probable
reason for it, that any but sound believers have such
a promise for their children, nor that any hypocrite
shall certainly save his child, if he do but dedicate
him to God in baptism. For, 1. I find no promise
in Scripture made to such. 2. He that doth not
sincerely believe himself, nor consent to God's covenant,
cannot sincerely believe for his child, nor consent
for him. 3. And that faith which will not save
the owner, as being not the condition of the promise,
cannot save another. Much more might be said of
this. I confess that the church is to receive the
children of hypocrites as well as themselves; and
their baptism is valid <i>in foro externo ecclesiæ</i>, and is
not to be reiterated. But it goeth no further for his
child, than for himself.</p>

<p>10. Therefore I think that all that are rightfully
baptized by the minister, that is, baptized so as that
it is well done of him, are not certainly saved by
baptism, unless they be also rightfully baptized, in
regard of their right to claim and receive it. Let
them that are able to prove more do it, for I am not
able.</p>

<p>11. Whereas some misinterpret the words of the
old rubric of confirmation in the English liturgy,
as if it spake of all that are baptized, whether they
had right or not, the words themselves may serve to
rectify that mistake, "And that no man shall think
any detriment shall come to children by deferring of
their confirmation, he shall know for truth, that it is
certain by God's word, that children being baptized
have all things necessary for their salvation, and be
undoubtedly saved." Where it is plain that they
mean, they have all things necessary <i>ex parte ecclesiæ</i>,
or all God's applying ordinances necessary,
though they should die unconfirmed, supposing that
they have all things necessary to just baptism on
their own part. Which is but what the ancients
were wont to say of the baptized adult; but they
never meant that the infidel, and hypocrite, and impenitent
person was in a state of life, because he
was baptized; but that all that truly consent to the
covenant, and signify this by being baptized, are
saved. So the church of England saith, that they
receive no detriment by delaying confirmation; but
it never said, that they receive no detriment by their
parents' or sponsors' infidelity and hypocrisy, or by
their want of true right <i>coram Deo</i> to be baptized.</p>

<p>12. But yet before these questions (either of them)
be taken as resolved by me, I must first take in some
other questions which are concerned in the same
cause; as,</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXVI. <i>What is meant by this speech, that believers and
their seed are in the covenant of God; which giveth them right to
baptism?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Though this was opened on thee by before
I add, 1. The meaning is not that they are in that
absolute promise of the first and all following grace,
supposed ordinarily to be made of the elect, (as such
unknown,) viz. I will give them faith, repentance,
conversion, justification, and salvation, and all the
conditions of the conditional promise, without any
condition on their part, which many take to be the
meaning of, I will take the hard heart out of them,
&amp;c. For, 1. This promise is not now to be first
performed to the adult who repent and believe
already; and no other are to be baptized at age. If
that absolute promise be sealed by baptism, either
it must be so sealed as a promise before it be performed,
or after; if before, either to all, because
some are elect, or only to some that are elect. Not to
all; for it is not common to infidels. Not to some
as elect; for, 1. They are unknown. 2. If they
were known, they are yet supposed to be infidels.
Not after performance, for then it is too late.</p>

<p>2. The meaning is not only that the conditional
covenant of grace is made and offered to them; for
so it may be said of heathens and infidels, and all
the world that hear the gospel.</p>

<p>But, 1. The covenant meant is indeed this conditional
covenant only, Mark xvi. 16, "He that believeth
and is baptized, shall be saved."</p>

<p>2. To be in this covenant is, to be a consenting
believer, and so to be one that hath by inward heart
consent the true conditions of right to the benefits
of the covenant, and is thereby prepared solemnly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">{654}</a></span>
by baptism to profess this consent, and to receive an
investiture and seal of God's part, by his minister
given in his name.</p>

<p>3. Infants are thus in covenant with their parents,
because reputatively their parents' wills are theirs,
to dispose of them for their good. And therefore
they consent by their parents, who consent for them.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXVII. <i>Are believers' children certainly in covenant before
their baptism, and thereby in a state of salvation? or not till they
are baptized?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Distinguish between, 1. Heart-covenanting
and mouth covenanting. 2. Between being in covenant
before God, and visibly before the church.</p>

<p>1. No person is to be baptized at age, whose inward
heart consent before professed, giveth him not
right to baptism. Therefore all the adult must be
in covenant, that is, consent on their part to the
covenant, before they are baptized.</p>

<p>2. Therefore it is so with the seed of the faithful,
who must consent by their parents, before they have
right; otherwise all should have right, and their
baptism be essentially another baptism, as sealing
some other covenant, or none.</p>

<p>3. If there be no promise made to the seed of the
faithful more than to others, they have no right
more than others to baptism or salvation. But if
there be a promise made to them as the seed of believers,
then are they as such within that promise,
that is, performers of its conditions by their parents,
and have right to the benefit.</p>

<p>4. If the heart consent or faith of the adult, do
put themselves into a state of salvation, before their
baptism, then it doth so by their children; but, &amp;c.&mdash;</p>

<p>5. But this right to salvation in parents and children
upon heart consent before baptism, is only before
God. For the church taketh no cognizance of
secret heart transactions; but a man then only consenteth
in the judgment of the church, when he
openly professeth it, and desireth to signify it by
being baptized.</p>

<p>6. And even before God, there is a <i>necessitas
præcepti</i> obliging us to open baptism after heart
consent; and he that heartily consenteth, cannot refuse
God's way of uttering it, unless either through
ignorance he know it not to be his duty, (for himself
and his child,) or through want of ability or opportunity
cannot have it. So that while a man is unbaptized,
somewhat is wanting to the completeness
of his right to the benefits of the covenant, viz. A
reception of investiture and possession in God's appointed
way; though it be not such a want, as shall
frustrate the salvation of those that did truly consent
in heart.</p>

<p>7. I take it therefore for certain, that the children
of true believers consent to the covenant by their
parents, and are as certainly saved if they die before
baptism, as after; though those that despise baptism,
when they know it to be a duty, cannot be thought
indeed to believe or consent for their children or
themselves.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXVIII. <i>Is infants' title to baptism and the covenant
benefits given them by God in his promise, upon any proper moral
condition, or only upon the condition of their natural relation, that
they be the seed of the faithful?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> That which is called a mere natural condition
is properly in law sense no condition at all; nor
doth make a contract or promise to be called conditional
in a moral sense. But it is matters of morality,
and not of physics only, that we are treating of; and
therefore we must take the terms in a moral sense.
For a physical condition is either past, or present,
or future, or not future; if it be past or present, the
proposition may indeed be hypothetical, but it is no
such conditional promise as we are speaking of; for
instance, if you say, If thou wast born in such a city,
or if thy name be John, I will give thee so much.
These are the words of an uncertain promiser; but
the promise is already either equivalent to an absolute
gift, or null. So if the physical condition be <i>de
futuro</i>, e.&nbsp;g. If thou be alive to-morrow, I will give thee
this or that; or if the sun shine to-morrow, &amp;c. This
indeed suspendeth the gift or event; but not upon
any moral being which is in the power of the receiver,
but upon a natural contingency or uncertainty.
And God hath no such conditional covenants or
promises to be sealed by baptism. He saith not, If
thou be the child of such or such a man, thou shalt
be saved, as his natural offspring only. If the
papists that accuse us for holding that the mere
natural progeny of believers are saved as such, did
well understand our doctrine, they would perceive
that in this we differ not from the understanding sort
among them, or at least, that their accusations run
upon a mistake.</p>

<p>I told you before that there are three things
distinctly to be considered in the title of infants to
baptism and salvation. 1. By what right the parent
covenanteth for his child. 2. What right the child
hath to baptism. 3. What right he hath to the
benefits of the covenant sealed and delivered in
baptism?</p>

<p>To the first, two things concur to the title of the
parent to covenant in the name of his child. One is
his natural interest in him; the child being his own
is at his disposal. The other is God's gracious will
and consent that it shall be so; that the parent's
will shall be as the child's for his good, till he come
at age to have a will of his own.</p>

<p>To the second, the child's right to baptism is not
merely his natural or his birth relation from such
parents, but it is in two degrees, as followeth: 1. He
hath a virtual right, on condition of his parent's
faith: the reason is, because that a believer's consent
and self-dedication to God doth virtually contain in
it a dedication with himself of all that is his: and it
is a contradiction to say that a man truly dedicateth
himself to God, and not all that he hath, and that
he truly consenteth to the covenant for himself and
not for his child, if he understand that God will accept
it. 2. His actual title condition is his parent's
(or owner's) actual consent to enter him into God's
covenant, and his actual mental dedication of his
child to God, which is his title before God, and the
profession of it is his title before the church. So
that it is not a mere physical but a moral title condition,
which an infant hath to baptism, that is, his
parent's consent to dedicate him to God.</p>

<p>3. And to the third, his title condition to the benefits
of baptism hath two degrees: 1. That he be
really dedicated to God by the heart consent of his
parent as aforesaid. And, 2. That his parent express
this by the solemn engaging him to God in baptism;
the first being necessary as a means <i>sine qua non</i>,
and the second being necessary as a duty without
which he sinneth, (when it is possible,) and as a
means <i>coram ecclesia</i> to the privileges of the visible
church.</p>

<p>The sum of all is, that our mere natural interest
in our children is not their title condition to baptism
or to salvation, but only that presupposed state
which enableth us by God's consent to covenant for
them; but their title condition to baptism and salvation,
is our covenanting for them, or voluntary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">{655}</a></span>
dedicating them to God; which we do, 1. Virtually,
when we dedicate ourselves, and all that we have or
shall have. 2. Actually, when our hearts consent
particularly for them, and actually devote them to
God, before baptism. 3. Sacramentally, when we
express this in our solemn baptismal covenanting
and dedication.</p>

<p>Consider exactly of this again; and if you loathe
distinguishing, confess ingenuously that you loathe
the truth, or the necessary means of knowing it.</p>

<h3>Quest. XXXIX. <i>What is the true meaning of sponsors,</i> patrimi, <i>or
godfathers as we call them? And is it lawful to make use of them?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I. To the first question; all men have not
the same thoughts either of their original, or of their
present use.</p>

<p>1. Some think that they were sponsors or sureties
for the parents rather than the child at first; and
that when many in times of persecution, heresy, and
apostasy, did baptize their children this month or
year, and the next month or year apostatize and
deny Christ themselves, that the sponsors were only
credible christians witnessing that they believed
that the parents were credible, firm believers, and
not like to apostatize. 2. Others think that they
were undertakers, that if the parents did apostatize
or die, they would see to the christian education of
the child themselves. 3. Others think that they did
both these together; (which is my opinion;) viz.
that they witnessed the probability of the parents'
fidelity; but promised that if they should either
apostatize or die, they would see that the children
were piously educated. 4. Others think that they
were absolute undertakers that the children should
be piously educated, whether the parents died or
apostatized or not; so that they went joint undertakers
with the parents in their lifetime. 5. And I
have lately met with some that maintain that the
godfathers and godmothers become proprietors, and
adopt the child, and take him for their own, and that
this is the sense of the church of England. But I
believe them not for these reasons.</p>

<p>1. There is no such word in the liturgy, doctrine,
or canons of the church of England: and that is not
to be feigned and fathered on them, which they
never said.</p>

<p>2. It would be against the law of nature to force
all parents to give the sole propriety, or joint propriety,
in their children to others. Nature hath given the
propriety to themselves, and we cannot rob them of it.</p>

<p>3. It would be heinously injurious to the children
of noble and learned persons, if they must be forced
to give them up to the propriety and education of
others, even of such as perhaps are lower and more
unfit for it than themselves.</p>

<p>4. It would be more heinously injurious to all godfathers
and godmothers, who must all make other
men's children their own, and therefore must use
them as their own.</p>

<p>5. It would keep most children unbaptized; because
if it were once understood that they must take
them as their own, few would be sponsors to the
children of the poor, for fear of keeping them; and
few but the ignorant that know not what they do,
would be sponsors for any, because of the greatness
of the charge, and their averseness to adopt the children
of others.</p>

<p>6. It would make great confusion in the state,
while all men were bound to exchange children with
another.</p>

<p>7. I never knew one man or woman that was a
godfather or godmother on such terms, nor that took
the child to be their own: and if such a one should
be found among ten thousand, that is no rule to discern
the judgment of the church by.</p>

<p>8. And in confirmation the godfather and godmother
is expressly said to be for this use, to be
witnesses that the party is confirmed.</p>

<p>9. And in the priest's speech to the adult that
come for baptism, in the office of baptism of those
of riper years, it is the persons themselves that are
to promise and covenant for themselves, and the
godfathers and godmothers are only called "these
your witnesses." And if they be but witnesses to the
adult, it is like they are not adopters of infants.</p>

<p>II. Those that doubt of the lawfulness of using
sponsors for their children, do it on these two accounts:
1. As supposing it unlawful to make so promiscuous
an adoption of children, or of choosing another
to be a covenanter for the child instead of the
parent, to whom it belongeth; or to commit their
children to another's either propriety, or education,
or formal promise of that which belongeth to education,
when they never mean to perform it, nor can
do. 2. Because they take it for an adding to the ordinance
of God, a thing which Scripture never mentioneth.
To which I answer,</p>

<p>1. I grant it unlawful to suppose another to be
the parent or proprietor that is not; or to suppose
him to have that power and interest in your child
which he hath not; or to desire him to undertake
what he cannot perform, and which neither he nor
you intend he shall perform; I grant that you are
not bound to alienate the propriety of your children,
nor to take in another to be joint proprietors; nor to
put out your children to the godfather's education.
So that if you will misunderstand the use of sponsors,
then indeed you will make them unlawful to be so used.</p>

<p>But if you take them but as the ancient churches
did, for such as do attest the parents' fidelity, (in
their persuasion,) and do promise first to mind you
of your duty, and next to take care of the children's
pious education if you die, I know no reason you
have to scruple this much.</p>

<p>Yea more, it is in your own power to agree with
the godfathers, that they shall represent your own
persons, and speak and promise what they do, as
your deputies only, in your names. And what have
you against this? Suppose you were sick, lame,
imprisoned, or banished, would you not have your
child baptized? And how should that be done, but
by your deputing another to represent you in entering
him into covenant with God?</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But when the churchmen mean another
thing, this is but to juggle with the world.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> How can you prove that the authority that
made or imposed the liturgy, meant any other thing?
And other individuals are not the masters of your
sense. Yea, and if the imposers had meant ill, in a
thing that may be done well, you may discharge your
conscience by doing it well, and making a sufficient
profession of your better sense.</p>

<p>2. And then it will be no sinful addition to God's
ordinance, to determine of a lawful circumstance,
which he hath left to human prudence: as to choose
a meet deputy, witness, or sponsor, who promiseth
nothing but what is meet.</p>

<h3>Quest. XL. <i>On whose account or right is it that the infant hath
title to baptism and its benefits? Is it on the parents', ancestors',
sponsors', the church's, the minister's, the magistrate's, or his
own?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The titles are very various that are pretended;
let us examine them all.</p>

<p>I. I cannot think that a magistrate's command to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">{656}</a></span>
baptize an infant, giveth him right, 1. Because there
is no proof of the validity of such a title. 2. Because
the magistrate can command no such thing if it be
against God's word, as this is, which would level the
case of the seed of heathens and believers. And I
know but few of that opinion.</p>

<p>II. I do not think that the minister as such giveth
title to the infant: for, 1. He is no proprietor.
2. He can show no such power or grant from God.
3. He must baptize none but those that antecedently
have right. 4. Else he also might level all, and
take in heathen's children with believers'. 5. Nor
is this pretended to by many, that I know of.</p>

<p>III. I cannot think that it is a particular church
that must give this right, or perform the condition
of it. For, 1. Baptism (as is aforesaid) as such,
doth only make a christian, and a member of the
universal church, and not of any particular church.
And, 2. The church is not the proprietor of the child.
3. No Scripture commission can be showed for such
a power. Where hath God said, All that any particular
church will receive, shall have right to baptism?
4. By what act must the church give this
right? If by baptizing him; the question is of his
antecedent right. If by willing that he be baptized;
(1.) If they will that one be baptized that hath no
right to it, their will is sinful, and therefore unfit to
give him right. (2.) And the baptizing minister
hath more power than a thousand or ten thousand
private men, to judge who is to be baptized. 5. Else
a church might save all heathen children that they
can but baptize, and so level infidels' and christians'
seed. 6. It is not the church in general, but some
one person, that must educate the child: therefore
the church cannot so much as promise for its education:
the church hath nothing to do with those
that are without, but only with her own; and heathen's
children are not her own, nor exposed to her
occupation.</p>

<p>IV. I believe not that it is the universal church
that giveth the infant title to baptism: for, 1. He that
giveth title to the covenant and baptism, doth it as
a performer of the moral condition of that title. But
God hath no where made the church's faith to be
the condition of baptism or salvation, either to infidels
or their seed. 2. Because the universal church
is a body that cannot be consulted with to give their
vote and consent: nor have they any deputies to
do it by. For there is no universal, visible governor:
and if you will pretend every priest to be commissioned
to act and judge in the name of the universal
church, you will want proof, and that is before confuted.
3. If all have right that the universal church
offereth up to God, or any minister or bishop be
counted its deputy or agent to that end, it is in the
power of that minister (as is said) to level all, and
to baptize and save all; which is contrary to the
word of God.</p>

<p>V. I believe that godfathers as such, being no
adopters or proprietors, are not the performers of
the condition of salvation for the infant, nor give
him right to be baptized. 1. Because he is not
their own, and therefore their will or act cannot go
for his; because there is no word of God for it that all
shall be baptized or saved that any christians will be
sponsors for. God's church blessings are not tied to
such inventions, that were not in being when God's
laws were made. Where there is no promise or
word, there is no faith. 3. No sponsors are so
much as lawful (as is showed before) who are not
owners or their deputies, or mere secondary subservient
parties, who suppose the principal covenanting
party. 4. And as to the infant's salvation, the
sponsors may (too oft) be ignorant infidels and
hypocrites themselves, that have no true faith for
themselves; and therefore not enough to save another.
5. And it were strange if God should make no promise
to a wicked parent for his own child, and yet
should promise to save by baptism all that some
wicked and hypocrite godfathers will offer him.
And that thus the seed of heathens and christians
should be levelled, and yet an ignorant, bold undertaker
to carry away the privilege of saving persons
from them both. All this is but men's unproved
imaginations. He that never commandeth godfathers,
but forbiddeth the usurping sort, and only
alloweth human prudence to use the lawful sort, did
never put the souls of all children, christians and
heathens, into their hands (any more than into the
hands of the priest that baptizeth them).</p>

<p>VI. I do not find that remote ancestors that are
dead, or that are not proprietors of the children, are
the performers of the condition by which they have
right to baptism or salvation. 1. Because God hath
put that power and work in the hands of others,
even the parents, which they cannot nullify. 2. Because
the promise of mercy to thousands is on supposition
that the successors make no intercision.
3. Else the threatenings to the seed of the wicked
would signify nothing, nor would any in the world
be excluded from right, but all be levelled; because
Noah was the common father of mankind: and if
you lay it on dead ancestors, you have no rule where
to stop till you come to Noah.</p>

<p>VII. I conclude therefore that it is, clearly, the
immediate parents, (both or one,) and probably any
true domestic owner of the child, who hath the
power to choose or refuse for him, and so to enter
him into covenant with God, and so by consent to
perform the conditions of his right. For, 1. Abundance
of promises are made to the faithful and their
seed, of which I have spoken at large in my book
"Of Infant Baptism." And besides the punishment
of Adam's sin, there is scarce a parent infamous for
sin in Scripture, but his posterity falleth under the
punishment, as for a secondary, original sin or guilt.
As the case of Cain, Ham, the Sodomites, the Amalekites,
the Jews, Achan, Gehazi, &amp;c. show. And
1&nbsp;Cor. vii. 14, it is expressly said, "Else were your
children unclean, but now are they holy" (of the
sense of which I have spoke as aforecited).</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But if owners may serve, one may buy
multitudes, and a king or lord of slaves, whose own
the people are, may cause them all to be baptized
and saved.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Remember that I say, that the christian
parent's right is clear, but I take the other as more
dark; for it is principally grounded on Abraham and
the Israelites circumcising their children born to them
in the house or bought with money: and how far the
parity of reason here will reach is hard to know.
All that I say is, that I will not deny it, because
<i>favores sunt ampliandi</i>. 2. If such a prince be a
hypocrite, and not a sincere christian himself, his
faith or consent cannot save others, that cannot save
himself. 3. It is such a propriety as is conjunct
with a divine concession only that giveth this power
of consenting for an infant: now we find clear proof
of God's concession to natural parents, and probable
proof of his concession of it to domestic owners, but
no further that I know of.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_280" id="Ref_280" href="#Foot_280">[280]</a></span>
For, (1.) It is an act of
God's love to the child for the parent's sake; and
therefore to such children as we are supposed to have
a special nearness to, and love for. (2.) And it is a
consent and covenanting which he calls for, which
obligeth the promiser to consequent pious education,
which is a domestic act. (3.) They are comprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">{657}</a></span>
in the name of parents, which those that adopt them
and educate them may be called. (4.) And the infants
are their children, not their slaves. But now,
if the emperor of Muscovy, Indostan, &amp;c. had the
propriety in all his people as slaves, this would not
imitate paternal interest and love, but tyranny, nor
could he be their domestic educater. Therefore I
must limit it to a pro-parent, or domestic, educating
proprietor.</p>

<h3>Quest. XLI. <i>Are they really baptized who are baptized according to
the English liturgy and canons, where the parent seemeth excluded, and
those to consent for the infant who have no power to do it?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I find some puzzled with this doubt,
Whether all our infants' baptism be not a mere nullity:
for, say they, the outward washing without
covenanting with God, is no more baptism, than the
body or corpse is a man. The covenant is the chief
essential part of baptism. And he that was never
entered into covenant with God was never baptized.
But infants according to the liturgy, are not entered
into covenant with God, which they would prove
thus: they that neither ever covenanted by themselves,
or by any authorized person for them, were never
entered into covenant with God (for that is no act of
theirs which is done by a stranger that hath no
power to do it); but, &amp;c.&mdash;That they did it not themselves
is undeniable: that they did it not by any person
empowered by God to do it for them they prove,
1. Because godfathers are the persons by whom the
infant is said to promise; but godfathers have no
power from God, (1.) Not by nature. (2.) Not by
Scripture. 2. Because the parents are not only not
included as covenanters, but positively excluded,
(1.) In that the whole office of covenanting for the
child from first to last is laid on others. (2.) In that
the twenty-ninth canon saith, "No parent shall be
urged to be present; nor admitted to answer as godfather
for his own child:" by which the parent that
hath the power is excluded: therefore our children
are all unbaptized.</p>

<p>To all this I answer, 1. That the parent's consent
is supposed, though he be absent. 2. That the parent
is not required to be absent, but only not to be
urged to be present; but he may if he will. 3. That
the reason of that canon seems to be their jealousy,
lest any would exclude godfathers. 4. While the
church hath no where declared what person the
sponsors bear, nor any further what they are to do,
than to speak the covenanting words, and promise to
see to the pious education of the child, the parents
may agree that the godfathers shall do all this as
their deputies, primarily, and in their steads, and
secondarily as friends that promise their assistance.
5. While parents really consent, it is not their silence
that nullifieth the covenant. 6. All parents are supposed
and required to be themselves the choosers of
the sponsors or sureties, and also to give notice to
the minister beforehand: by which it appeareth that
their consent is presupposed. And though my own
judgment be, that they should be the principal
covenanters for the child expressly, yet the want of
that expressness, will not make us unbaptized
persons.</p>

<h3>Quest. XLII. <i>But the great question is, How the Holy Ghost is given
to infants in baptism? And whether all the children of true christians
have inward sanctifying grace? or whether they can be said to be
justified, and to be in a state of salvation, that are not inherently
sanctified? And whether any fall from this infant state of
salvation?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Of all these great difficulties I have said
what I know, in my "Appendix to Infant Baptism,"
to Mr. Bradford and Dr. Ward, and of Bishop Davenant's
judgment. And I confess that my judgment
agreeth more in this with Davenant's than any
others, saving that he doth not so much appropriate
the benefits of baptism to the children of sincere believers
as I do. And though by a letter in pleading
Davenant's cause, I was the occasion of good Mr.
Gataker's printing of his answer to him, yet I am
still most inclined to his judgment; not that all the
baptized, but that all the baptized seed of true christians,
are pardoned, justified, adopted, and have a
title to the Spirit and salvation.</p>

<p>But the difficulties in this case are so great, as
drive away most who do not equally perceive the
greater inconveniences which we must choose, if this
opinion be forsaken: that is, that all infants must be
taken to be out of the covenant of God, and to have
no promise of salvation. Whereas surely the law of
grace as well as the covenant of works included all
the seed in their capacity.</p>

<p>1. To the first of these questions, I answer, 1. As
all true believers, so all their infants do receive initially
by the promise, and by way of obsignation and
sacramental investiture in baptism, a <i>jus relationis</i>, a
right of peculiar relation to all the three persons in
the blessed Trinity: as to God, as their reconciled,
adopting Father; and to Jesus Christ, as their Redeemer
and actual Head and Justifier; so also to the
Holy Ghost, as their Regenerator and Sanctifier.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_281" id="Ref_281" href="#Foot_281">[281]</a></span>
This right and relation adhereth to them, and is
given them in order to future actual operation and
communion: as a marriage covenant giveth the relation
and right to one another, in order to the subsequent
communion and duties of a married life; and
as he that sweareth allegiance to a king, or is listed
into an army, or is entered into a school, receiveth
the right and relation, and is so correlated, as
obligeth to the mutual subsequent offices of each,
and giveth right to many particular benefits. By
this right and relation, God is his own God and
Father; Christ is his own Head and Saviour; and
the Holy Spirit is his own Sanctifier, without asserting
what operations are already wrought on his soul,
but only to what future ends and uses these relations
are. Now as these rights and relations are
given immediately, so those benefits which are relative,
and the infant immediately capable of them,
are presently given by way of communion: he hath
presently the pardon of original sin, by virtue of the
sacrifice, merit, and intercession of Christ. He hath
a state of adoption, and right to divine protection,
provision, and church communion according to his
natural capacity, and right to everlasting life.</p>

<p>2. It must be carefully noted, that the relative
union between Christ the Mediator and the baptized
persons, is that which in baptism is first given in
order of nature, and that the rest do flow from this.
The covenant and baptism deliver the covenanter, 1.
From divine displicency by reconciliation with the
Father: 2. From legal penalties by justification by
the Son: 3. From sin itself by the operations of the
Holy Ghost. But it is Christ as our Mediator-Head,
that is first given us in relative union; and then, 1.
The Father loveth us with complacency as in the
Son, and for the sake of his first Beloved. 2. And
the Spirit which is given us in relation is first the
Spirit of Christ our Head, and not first inherent in
us; so that by union with our Head, that Spirit is
next united to us, both relatively, and as radically
inherent in the human nature of our Lord, to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">{658}</a></span>
we are united.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_282" id="Ref_282" href="#Foot_282">[282]</a></span>
As the nerves and animal spirits
which are to operate in all the body, are radically
only in the head, from whence they flow into and
operate on the members as there is need (though
there may be obstructions); so the Spirit dwelleth
in the human nature of our Head, and there it can
never be lost; and it is not necessary that it dwell in
us by way of radication, but by way of influence and
operation.</p>

<p>These things are distinctly and clearly understood
but by very few; and we are all much in the dark
about them. But I think, (however doctrinally we
may speak better,) that most christians are habituated
to this perilous misapprehension, (which is partly
against Christianity itself,) that the Spirit floweth
immediately from the divine nature of the Father
and the Son (as to the authoritative or potestative
conveyance) unto our souls. And we forget that it
is first given to Christ in his glorified humanity as
our Head, and radicated in Him; and that it is the
office of this glorified Head, to send or communicate
to all his members from himself, that Spirit which
must operate in them as they have need.</p>

<p>This is plain in many texts of Scripture. Rom.
viii. 32, "He that spared not his own Son, but gave
him up for us all, how shall he not also with him
freely give us all things?" (when he giveth him
particularly to us).</p>

<p>1&nbsp;John v. 11, 12, "And this is the record that God
hath given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son;
he that hath the Son hath the life, and he that hath
not the Son hath not the life."</p>

<p>Rom. viii. 9, "If any man have not the Spirit of
Christ, the same is none of his."</p>

<p>Eph. i. 22, 23, "And gave him to be the Head
over all things to the church, which is his body, the
fulness of him that filleth all in all."</p>

<p>John xv. 26, "The Advocate or Comforter whom
I will send unto you from the Father," &amp;c.</p>

<p>John xvi. 7, "If I depart, I will send him unto
you."</p>

<p>John xiv. 26, "The Comforter, whom the Father
will send in my name."</p>

<p>Gal. iv. 6, "And because ye are sons, God hath
sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts,
crying Abba, Father."</p>

<p>Gal. ii. 20, "I live: yet not I, but Christ liveth in
me." (I know that is true of his living in us objectively
and finally, but that seemeth not to be all.)</p>

<p>Col. iii. 3, 4, "For ye are dead, and your life is
hid with Christ in God; when Christ who is our life
shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in
glory." I know that in verse 3, by life is meant
felicity or glory; but not only; as appeareth by
verse 4, where Christ is called our life.</p>

<p>Matt. xxviii. 18, "All power is given unto me in
heaven and earth." ver. 20, "I am with you
always." John xiii. 3, "The Father hath given
all things into his hands."</p>

<p>John xvii. 2, 3, "Thou hast given him power over
all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many
as thou hast given him; and this is life eternal, to
know thee," &amp;c.</p>

<p>John v. 21, "The Son quickeneth whom he will:"
ver. 26, "For as the Father hath life in himself, so
hath he given to the Son to have life in himself."</p>

<p>John vi. 27, "Labour for that meat which endureth
to everlasting life, which the Son of man
shall give unto you, for him hath God the Father
sealed." Ver. 33, "He giveth life unto the
world." Ver. 54-57, "Whoso eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood hath eternal life&mdash;&mdash;dwelleth
in me and I in him&mdash;&mdash;my flesh is meat indeed&mdash;&mdash;As
the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the
Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by
me." Ver. 63, "It is the Spirit that quickeneth:
the flesh profiteth nothing."</p>

<p>John vii. 39, "This spake he of the Spirit, which
they that believe in him should receive." John iii.
34, "God giveth not the Spirit to him by measure."</p>

<p>1&nbsp;Cor. vi. 17, "He that is joined to the Lord is
one spirit."</p>

<p>2&nbsp;Cor. iii. 17, "The Lord is the Spirit, and where
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."</p>

<p>Phil. i. 19, "Through the supply of the Spirit of
Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>John xv. 4, 5, "Abide in me and I in you: as the
branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in
the vine, no more can ye except ye abide in me. I
am the vine, ye are the branches: he that abideth in
me and I in him, the same bringeth forth much
fruit: for without me (or, out of me, or, severed
from me) ye can do nothing."</p>

<p>I will add no more: all this is proof enough that
the Spirit is not given radically or immediately from
God to any believer, but to Christ, and so derivatively
from him to us. Not that the divine nature
in the third person is subject to the human nature in
Christ; but that God hath made it the office of our
Mediator's glorified humanity, to be the cistern that
shall first receive the waters of life, and convey them
by the pipes of his appointed means to all the offices
of his house: or to be the head of the animal spirits,
and by nerves to convey them to all the members.</p>

<p>3. We are much in the dark concerning the degree
of infants' glory; and therefore we can as little
know, what degree of grace is necessary to prepare
them for their glory.</p>

<p>4. It is certain that infants before they are glorified,
shall have all that grace that is prerequisite to
their preparation and fruition.</p>

<p>5. No sanctified person on earth is in an immediate
capacity for glory; because their sin and imperfection
must be done away, which is done at the dissolution
of soul and body. The very accession of the
soul to God doth perfect it.</p>

<p>6. Infants have no actual faith, or hope, or love
to God to exercise; and therefore need not the influence
of the Spirit of Christ to exercise them.</p>

<p>7. We are all so very much in the dark, as to the
clear and distinct apprehension of the true nature of
original inherent pravity or sin, that we must needs
be as much ignorant of the true nature of that inherent
sanctity or righteousness, which is its contrary
or cure. Learned Illiricus thought it was a
substance, which he hath in his "Clavis" pleaded
for at large. Others call it a habit; others a nature
or natural inclination, and a privation of a natural
inclination to God. Others call it an indisposition
of the mind and will to holy truth and goodness,
and an ill disposition of them to error and evil.
Others call it only the inordinate lust of the sensitive
faculties, with a debility of reason and will to resist
it. And whilst the nature of the soul itself and its
faculties, are so much unknown to itself, the nature
of original pravity and righteousness must needs be
very much unknown.</p>

<p>8. Though an infant be a distinct natural person
from his parents, yet is he not actually a distinct
person morally, as being not a moral agent, and so
not capable of moral actions good or evil. Therefore
his parents' will goeth for his.</p>

<p>9. His first acceptance into the complacential love
of God, (as distinct from his love of benevolence,)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">{659}</a></span>
is not for any inherent holiness in himself; but, (1.)
As the child of a believing parent who hath dedicated
him to Christ; and, (2.) As a member of
Christ, in whom he is well pleased.</p>

<p>10. Therefore God can complacentially as well as
benevolently love an infant in Christ, who only believeth
and repenteth by the parents, and not by
himself, and is not yet supposed to have the Spirit
of sanctification.</p>

<p>11. For the Spirit of sanctification is not the presupposed
condition of his acceptance into covenant
with God, but a gift of the covenant of God itself,
following both the condition on our part, and our
right to be covenanters, or to God's promise upon
that condition.</p>

<p>12. So the adult themselves have the operation of
the Spirit by which they believe and repent, by
which they come to have their right to God's part
in the covenant of baptism (for this is antecedent
to their baptism); but they have not the gift of the
Spirit, which is called in Scripture the "Spirit of
sanctification, and of power, love, and a sound mind,"
and is the benefit given by the covenant of baptism,
till afterward; because they must be in that covenant
before it can be made good to them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_283" id="Ref_283" href="#Foot_283">[283]</a></span>
And their
faith or consent is their infant's right also, antecedent
to the covenant gift.</p>

<p>13. There is therefore some notable difference between
that work of the Spirit by which we first
repent and believe, and so have our title to the promise
of the Spirit, and that gift of the Spirit which
is promised to believers; which is not only the
Spirit of miracles, given in the first times, but some
notable degree of love to our reconciled Father,
suitable to the grace and gospel of redemption and
reconciliation, and is called the "Spirit of Christ,"
and the "Spirit of adoption,"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_284" id="Ref_284" href="#Foot_284">[284]</a></span>
which the apostles
themselves seem not to have received till Christ's
ascension. And this seemeth to be not only different
from the gifts of the Spirit common to hypocrites
and the unbelievers, but also from the special gift of
the Spirit which maketh men believers. So that
Mr. Tho. Hooker saith trulier than once I understood,
that vocation is a special grace of the Spirit,
distinct from common grace on the one side, and
from sanctification on the other side. Whether it
be the same degree of the Spirit which the faithful
had before Christ's incarnation, which causeth men
first to believe distinct from the higher following
degree, I leave to inquiry; but the certainest distinction
is from the different effects.</p>

<p>14. Though an infant cannot be either disposed to
a holy life, or fit for glory immediately, without an
inward holiness of his own, yet by what is said it
seemeth plain, that merely on the account of the
condition performed by the parent, and of his union
relatively with Christ thereupon, and his title to
God's promise on these grounds, he may be said to
be in a state of salvation; that is, to have the pardon
of his original sin, deliverance from hell, (in right,)
adoption, and a right to the needful operations of
the Holy Ghost, as given to him in Christ, who is
the first receiver of the Spirit.</p>

<p>15. But when and in what sort and degree Christ
giveth the actual operations of the Spirit to all
covenanted infants, it is wonderfully hard for us to
know. But this much seemeth clear, 1. That Christ
may when he please work on the soul of an infant
to change its disposition, before it come to the use of
reason. 2. That Christ and his Spirit as in covenant
with infants, are ready to give all necessary assistance
to infants for their inherent sanctification, in
the use of those means, and on those further conditions,
on which we must wait for it and expect it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_285" id="Ref_285" href="#Foot_285">[285]</a></span>
For the Holy Ghost is not so engaged to us in our
covenant or baptism, as to be obliged presently to
give us all the grace that we want; but only to give
it us on certain further conditions, and in the use of
certain means. But because this leads me up to another
question, I will suspend the rest of the answer
to this till that be handled. Only I must answer
this objection.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> It is contrary to the holy nature of God,
complacentially to love an unsanctified infant, that
is yet in his original corruption unchanged, and he
justifieth none relatively from the guilt of sin, whom
he doth not at once inherently sanctify.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. God's complacential love respecteth
every one as he is; for it is goodness only that he
so loveth. Therefore he so loveth not those that
either actually or habitually love not him, under any
false supposition that they do love him when they
do not. His love therefore to the adult and infants
differeth as the objects differ. But there is this
lovely in such infants; 1. That they are the children
of believing, sanctified parents; 2. That they
are by his covenant relatively united to Christ, and
so are lovely as his members; 3. That they are pardoned
all their original sin; 4. That they are set in
the way to actual love and holiness; being thus dedicated
to God.</p>

<p>2. All imperfect saints are sinners; and all sinners
are as such abhorred of God, whose pure eyes
cannot behold iniquity. As then it will stand with
his purity to accept and love the adult upon their
first believing, before their further sanctification, and
notwithstanding the remnant of their sins, so may it
do also to accept their infants through Christ upon
their dedication.</p>

<p>3. As the actual sin imputed to infants was Adam's,
and their parents' only by act, and not their own, it
is no wonder if upon their parents' faith and repentance,
Christ wash and justify them from that guilt
which arose only from another's act.</p>

<p>4. And then the inherent pravity was the effect of
that act of their ancestors, which is forgiven them.
And this pravity or inherent, original sin may two
ways be said to be mortified radically, or virtually,
or inceptively before any inherent change in them:
1. In that it is mortified in their parents from whom
they derived it, who have the power of choosing for
them; and, 2. In that they are by covenant ingrafted
into Christ, and so related to the cause of their future
sanctification; yea, 3. In that also they are by covenant
and their parents' promise, engaged to use those
means which Christ hath appointed for sanctification.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_286" id="Ref_286" href="#Foot_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>5. And it must be remembered that as this is but
an inceptive, preparatory change, so the very pardon
of the inherent vitiosity is not perfect, (as I have
elsewhere largely proved,) however some papists and
protestants deny it. While sin remaineth, sin and
corruption is still indwelling, besides all the unremoved
penalties of it, the very being of it proveth it
to be so far unpardoned, in that it is not yet abolished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">{660}</a></span>
and the continuance of it being not its smallest punishment,
as permitted, and the Spirit not given so
far as to cure it. Imperfect pardon may consist
with a present right both to further sanctification by
the Spirit, and so to heaven.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Christ's body hath no unholy members.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. 1&nbsp;Cor. vii. 14, "Now are your children
holy." They are not wholly unholy who have all
the fore-described holiness. 2. As infants in nature
want memory and actual reason, and yet initially are
men; so, as Christ's members, they may want actual
and habitual faith and love, and yet initially be sanctified,
by their union with him and his Spirit, and
their parents' dedication, and be in the way for more,
as they grow fit; and be christians and saints <i>in fieri</i>,
or initially only, as they are men.</p>

<h3>Quest. XLIII. <i>Is the right of the baptized (infants or adult) to
the sanctifying operations of the Holy Ghost, now absolute, or
suspended on further conditions? And are the parents' further duties
for their children such conditions of their children's reception of
the actual assistances of the Spirit? Or are children's own actions
such conditions? And may apostate parents forfeit the covenant
benefits to their baptized infants or not?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The question is great and difficult, and few
dare meddle with it. And almost all infant cases
are to us obscure.</p>

<p>I. 1. It is certain that it is the parents' great duty
to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord.</p>

<p>2. It is certain that God hath appointed this to be
the means of their actual knowledge, faith, and
holiness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_287" id="Ref_287" href="#Foot_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>3. And God doth not appoint such means unnecessarily
or in vain: nor may we ordinarily expect
his grace but in the use of the means of grace, which
he hath appointed us to use.</p>

<p>4. It is certain that God's receiving the children
of the faithful, is an act of God's love to the parents
as well as the children, and promised as a part of
his blessing on themselves.</p>

<p>5. It is certain that these parents hold their own
mercies upon the condition of their own continued
fidelity: and (let their apostasy be on other reasons
never so impossible, or not future, yet) the promise
of continuance and consummation of the personal
felicity of the greatest saint on earth, is still conditional,
upon the condition of his persevering fidelity.</p>

<p>6. Even before children are capable of instruction,
there are certain duties imposed by God on the parents
for their sanctification; viz. 1. That the parents
pray earnestly and believingly for them. 2.
That they themselves so live towards God as may
invite him still to bless their children for their sakes,
as he did Abraham's, and usually did to the faithful's
seed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_288" id="Ref_288" href="#Foot_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>7. It is certain that the church ever required
parents, not only to enter their children into the
covenant, and so to leave them, but to do their after
duty for their good, and to pray for them, and educate
them according to their covenant.</p>

<p>8. It is plain that if there were none to promise so
to educate them, the church would not baptize them.
And God himself, who allowed the Israelites, and
still alloweth us to bring our children into his covenant,
doth it on this supposition, that we promise
also to go on to do our duty for them, and that we
actually do it.</p>

<p>9. All this set together maketh it plain, 1. That
God never promiseth the adult in baptism, though
true believers, that he will work in them all graces
further by his sanctifying Spirit, let them never so
much neglect or resist him; or that he will absolutely
see that they never shall resist him: nor that the
Spirit shall still help them, though they neglect all
his means; or that he will keep them from neglecting
the means (election may secure this to the elect
as such; but the baptismal covenant as such, secureth
it not to the baptized, nor to believers as such).
2. And consequently that infants are in covenant
with the Holy Ghost still conditionally as their parents
are; and that the meaning of it is that the Holy
Ghost as your Sanctifier will afford you all necessary
help, in the use of those means which he hath appointed
you to receive his help in.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_289" id="Ref_289" href="#Foot_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Infants have no means to use.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> While infants stand on their parents' account,
or wills, the parents have means to use for the
continuance of their grace, as well as for the beginning
of it.</p>

<p>10. Therefore I cannot see but that if a believer
should apostatize, (whether any do so is not the question)
and his infant not to be made another's child,
he forfeiteth the benefits of the covenant to his infant.
But if the propriety in the infant be transferred
to another, it may alter the case.</p>

<p>11. And how dangerously parents may make partial
forfeitures of the Spirit's assistance to their
children, and operations on them, by their own sinful
lives, and neglect of prayer, and of prudent and
holy education, even in particular acts, I fear many
believing parents never well considered.</p>

<p>12. Yet is not this forfeiture such as obligeth God
to deny his Spirit; for he may do with his own, as
a free benefactor, as he list; and may have mercy
freely, beyond his promise, (though not against his
word,) on whom he will have mercy. But I say that
he that considereth the woeful unfaithfulness and
neglect of most parents, even the religious, in the
great work of holy educating their children, may
take the blame of their ungodliness on themselves,
and not lay it on Christ or the Spirit who was in
covenant with them as their Sanctifier, seeing he
promised but conditionally to give them the sanctifying
heavenly influences of his life, light, and love,
in their just use of his appointed means, according
to their abilities.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_290" id="Ref_290" href="#Foot_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Also as soon as children come to a little use
of reason, they stand conjunctly on their parents'
wills and on their own. As their parents are bound
to teach and rule them, so they are bound to learn
of them and be ruled by them for their good. And
though every sin of a parent or a child be not a total
forfeiture of grace, yet both their notable actual sins
may justly be punished, with a denial of some
further help of the Spirit which they grieve and
quench.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">{661}</a></span>
II. And now I may seasonably answer the former
question, whether infants' baptismal saving grace
may be lost, of which I must for the most that is to
be said refer the reader to Davenant (in Mr. Bedford's
book) on this subject, and to Dr. Samuel Ward
joined with it, (though Mr. Gataker's answers are
very learned and considerable,) and to my small
book called "My Judgment of Perseverance."</p>

<p>Augustine, who first rose up for the doctrine of
perseverance, against its adversaries, carried it no
higher than to all the elect as such, and not at all to
all the sanctified; but oft affirmeth that some that
were justified, sanctified, and love God, and are in a
state of salvation, are not elect, and fall away; but
since the reformation, great reasons have been
brought to carry it further to all the truly sanctified;
of which cause Zanchius was one of the first learned
and zealous patrons, that with great diligence in long
disputations maintained it. All that I have now to
say is, that I had rather with Davenant believe that
the fore-described infant state of salvation, which
came by the parents, may be lost by the parents and
the children, (though such a sanctified, renewed
nature in holy habits of love as the adult have be
never lost,) than believe that no infants are in the
covenant of grace and to be baptized.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the child once in possession shall not
be punished for the parents' sin.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. This point is not commonly well understood.
I have by me a large disputation proving
from the current of Scripture, a secondary original
sin, besides that from Adam, and a secondary punishment
ordinarily inflicted on children for their parents'
sins, besides the common punishment of the
world for the first sin. 2. But the thing in question
is but a loss of that benefit which they received and
hold only by another. It is not so properly called a
punishment for another's sin, as a non-deliverance,
or a non-continuance of their deliverance, which
they were to receive on the condition of another's
duty.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the church retaineth them as her
members, and so their right is not lost by the fault
or apostasy of the parents.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Lost it is one way or other, with multitudes
of true christians' children, who never show
any signs of grace, and prove sometimes the worst
of men. And God breaketh not his covenant.</p>

<p>2. How doth the church keep the Greeks' children
that are made janizaries?</p>

<p>3. No man stayeth in the church without title. If
the church or any christians take them as their own,
that is another matter. I will not now stay to discuss
the question, whether apostates' baptized infants
be still church members? But what I have said
of their right before God, seemeth plain.</p>

<p>4. And mark, that on whomsoever you build an
infant's right, you may as well say, that he may
suffer for other men's default; for if you build it on
the magistrate, the minister, the church, the godfathers,
any of them may fail; they may deny him
baptism itself; they may fail in his education; shall
he suffer then for want of baptism or good education
when it is their faults? Whoever a child or a man is
to receive a benefit by, the failing of that person
may deprive him of that benefit. More objections I
must pretermit, to avoid prolixity.</p>

Mr. Whiston, p. 53. As Abraham as a single person in
the covenant was to accept of and perform the conditions of
the covenant&mdash;so as a parent he had something of duty incumbent
on him with reference to his (immediate) seed; and
as his faithful performance of that duty incumbent on him in
his single capacity, so his performing that duty incumbent on
him as a parent in reference to his seed, was absolutely necessary
in order to his enjoying the good promised, with
reference to himself and his seed: proved Gen. xvii. 1; xviii.
19. He proveth that the promise is conditional, and that as
to the continuance of the covenant state the conditions are,
1. The parent's upright life. 2. His duty to his children
well done. 3. The children's own duty as they are capable.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XLIV. <i>Doth baptism always oblige us at the present, and give
grace at the present? And is the grace which is not given till long
after, given by baptism: or an effect of baptism?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I add this case for two reasons: 1. To open
their pernicious error who think that a covenant or promise
made by us to God, only for a future, distant duty,
(as to repent and believe before we die,) is all that is
essential to our baptismal covenanting. 2. To open
the ordinary saying of many divines, who say, that
baptism worketh not always at the present, but
sometimes only long afterward. The truth I think
may be thus expressed.</p>

<p>1. It is not baptism, if there be not the profession
of a present belief, a present consent, and a present
dedition, or resignation, or dedication of the person
to God, by the adult for themselves, and by parents
for their infants. He that only saith, I promise to
believe, repent, and obey only at twenty or thirty
years of age, is not morally baptized; for it is another
covenant of his own which he would make,
which God accepteth not.</p>

<p>2. It is not only a future, but a present relation to
God, as his own, his subjects, his children by redemption,
to which the baptized person doth consent.</p>

<p>3. It is a present correlation, and not a future only,
to which God consenteth on his part, to be their
Father, Saviour, and Sanctifier, their Owner peculiarly,
their Ruler graciously, and their chief Benefactor,
and Felicity, and End.</p>

<p>4. It is not only a future but a present remission
of sin, and adoption and right to temporal and eternal
mercies, which God giveth to true consenters by
his covenant and baptism.</p>

<p>5. But those mercies which we are not at that
present capable of, are not to be given at the present,
but afterward when we are capable; as the particular
assistances of the Spirit, necessary upon all future
particular occasions, &amp;c.; the pardon of future sins;
actual glorification, &amp;c.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_291" id="Ref_291" href="#Foot_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>6. And the duties which are to be performed only
for the future, we must promise at present to perform
only for the future, in their season, to our lives'
end. Therefore we cannot promise that infants
shall believe, obey, or love God, till they are naturally
capable of doing it.</p>

<p>7. If any hypocrite do not indeed repent, believe,
or consent when he is baptized, or baptizeth his
child, he so far faileth in the covenant professed;
and so much of baptism is undone; and God doth
not enter into the present covenant relations to him,
as being incapable thereof.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_292" id="Ref_292" href="#Foot_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>8. If this person afterwards repent and believe, it
is a doing of the same thing which was omitted in
baptism, and a making of the same covenant; but
not as a part of his baptism itself, which is long past.</p>

<p>9. Nor is he hereupon to be re-baptized; because
the external part was done before, and is not to be
twice done; but the internal part which was omitted,
is now to be done, not as a part of baptism, (old or
new,) but as a part of penitence, for his omission.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> If covenanting be a part of baptism, then
this person, whose covenant is never a part of his
baptism, doth live and die unbaptized.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> As baptism signifieth only the external ordinance,
heart covenanting is no part of it, but the
profession of it is; and if there was no profession of
faith made, by word or sign, the person is unbaptized.
But as baptism signifieth the internal part with the
external, so he will be no baptized person while he
liveth; that is, one that in baptism did truly consent,
and receive the spiritual relations to God; but he
will have the same thing in another way of God's
appointment.</p>

<p>10. When this person is after sanctified, it is by
God's performance of the same covenant in specie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">{662}</a></span>
which baptism is made to seal, that God doth pardon,
justify, and adopt him; but this is not by his past
baptism as a cause, but by after grace and absolution.
The same covenant doth it, but not baptism;
because indeed the covenant or promise saith, Whenever
thou believest and repentest, I will forgive
thee; but baptism saith, Because thou now believest,
I do forgive thee, and wash away thy sin; and maketh
present application.</p>

<p>11. So if an infant or adult person live without
grace, and at age be ungodly, his baptismal covenant
is violated; and his after conversion (or faith and
repentance) is neither the fulfilling of God's covenant,
nor of his baptism neither. The reason is, because
though pardon and adoption be given by that
conditional covenant of grace which baptism sealeth,
yet so is not that first grace of faith and repentance
which is the condition of pardon and adoption, and
the title to baptism itself. Else infidels should have
right to baptism, and thereby to faith and repentance.
But these are only the free gifts of God to the elect,
and the fulfilling of some absolute predictions concerning
the calling of the elect, and the fulfilling of
God's will or covenant to Christ the Mediator, that
"He shall see the travail of his soul and be satisfied,"
and possess those that are given him by the
Father.</p>

<p>12. But when the condition of the covenant is at
first performed by the parent for the infant, and this
covenant never broken on this child's behalf, (notwithstanding
sins of infirmity,) in this case the first
actual faith and repentance of children as they grow
up, is from God's fulfilling of his baptismal covenant
with them. The reason is, because that God in that
covenant did give them a right of relation to the
Holy Spirit in Christ their Head, as their Sanctifier,
to operate on them as they are capable. But if they
first prove apostates and be after converted, God is
disobliged (yea, to hypocrites never was obliged) as
to the engagement made by him in baptism; and
doth now, 1. Freely give them faith and repentance
as a benefactor to his elect, and then, 2. As a covenanter
give them pardon and adoption, &amp;c.</p>

<p>13. So to the adult, that truly made the baptismal
covenant and never apostatized from it, all the grace
that God giveth them through their lives, is his fulfilling
of his promises made to them, and sealed by
baptism, and a fruit of their baptism. But to hypocrites
and apostates it is otherwise, as is before explained.</p>

<h3>Quest. XLV. <i>What is a proper violation of our baptismal
covenant?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Note well, that there is a wide difference
between these questions, 1. When doth a man miss
of, or lose, his present part in the covenant or promise
of God in the gospel?<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_293" id="Ref_293" href="#Foot_293">[293]</a></span>
(This is as long as he is impenitent,
an unbeliever and refuser.) 2. When doth
a man totally lose his part and hope in that promise
or covenant of God, so as to be liable to all the penalty
of it? (That is only by final impenitence, unbelief
and refusal, when life is ended.) 3. And when
doth a man violate his own covenant or promise
made to God in baptism? Which is our present
question. To which I answer,</p>

<p>1. This promise hath parts essential and parts integral:
we promise not both these parts alike, nor
on the same terms; though both be promised. The
essential parts, are our essential duties of christianity,
(faith, love, repentance in the essential
parts,) &amp;c. The integrals are the integral duties of
Christianity.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_294" id="Ref_294" href="#Foot_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>2. He that performeth not the essential duties is
an apostate, or hypocrite.</p>

<p>3. He that performeth not the integral duties is a
sinner, not only against the law of nature, and Christ's
precepts, but his own promise; (and in this sense
we all confess our breach of covenant with Christ;)
but he is no apostate, hypocrite, or out of covenant.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XLVI. <i>May not baptism in some cases be repeated? And
when?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. You must distinguish between baptism,
taken morally, or only physically. 2. Between baptism
morally, as it is a church or visible covenant,
and as a heart covenant. 3. Between real baptism,
and seeming baptism, which is a nullity. 4. Between
certain reception of baptism, and that which is uncertain
or justly doubted of. And so I answer,</p>

<p>1. Real and certain baptism as a visible church
ordinance may not be repeated; though the heart
covenant was wanting; and though it wanted not
only decent modes, but integral parts.</p>

<p>2. But in these cases baptism may be used where
it seemed to have been received before.</p>

<p>1. When the person made no profession of the
christian faith (nor his parents for him, if an infant).
2. If that profession notoriously wanted an essential
part; as if he only professed to believe in God the
Father, and not in the Son, or the Holy Ghost. 3.
If the minister only baptized him into the name of
the Father, or Son, or left out any essential part. 4.
If the person or ministry only contracted for a distant
futurity, (as, I will be a christian when I am
old, &amp;c.) and not for the present; which is not to be
christened, but only to promise to be christened
hereafter. 5. If all application of water (or any
watery element) was omitted, which is the external
sign. 6. Of the baptizer's power I shall speak anon.
7. If the church or the person himself have just
cause of doubting, whether he was truly baptized
or not, to do it again, with hypothetical expressions,
If thou art not baptized, I baptize thee; yea, or
simply while that is understood, is lawful, and fit.
And it is not to be twice baptized morally, but only
physically, as I have fully opened in the question of
re-ordination, to which I must refer the reader.</p>

<p>3. And I confess I make little doubt but that
those in Acts xix. were re-baptized, notwithstanding
the witty evasion invented by Phil. Marnixius Aldegondus,
and Beza's improvement of it, and the now
common reception of that interpretation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_295" id="Ref_295" href="#Foot_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>For, 1. A new and forced exposition which no
reader dreameth of till it be put into his head, is
usually to be suspected, lest art deceive us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Whether it were re-baptizing.</div>

<p>2. The omission of the Holy Ghost
is an essential defect, and maketh
baptism specifically another thing;
and he were now to be re-baptized who should be
so baptized.</p>

<p>3. Whatever some say in heat against the papists,
John's baptism and our christian baptism are so specifically
distinct also, that he that had now but John's
were to be yet baptized: the person of the Messiah
himself being not determinately put into John's baptism
as such. Nor can it be supposed that all the
Jews that John baptized, were baptized into the profession
of faith in this numerical person Jesus, but
only to an unknown Saviour undetermined: however
he pointed to Christ in the hearing of some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">{663}</a></span>
his disciples. We must not run from plain truth
in peevishness or opposition to papists or any other
men.</p>

<p>4. The fifth verse would not be true of John's
baptism, as the history showeth, that "when John's
hearers heard this, they were baptized into the name
of the Lord Jesus." This is contrary to the text
that recordeth it.</p>

<p>5. In the fourth verse, the words "that is, on
Christ Jesus" are plainly Paul's expository words
of John's, and not John's words. John baptized
them "into the name of the Messiah that should
come after him," which indeed, saith Paul, was
Christ Jesus, though not then personally determined
by John.</p>

<p>6. The connexion of the fourth, fifth, and sixth
verses puts all out of doubt. 1. In the fourth verse
the last words are Paul's, "that is, on Christ Jesus."
2. In the next words, verse 4, "When they heard
this, they were baptized," &amp;c. must refer to the last
words, or to his that was speaking to them. 3.
Verse 6, the pronoun "them," "when Paul had laid
his hands on them," plainly referreth to them last
spoken of, verse 5, which therefore were not John's
hearers as such. 4. And the words, "they were
baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus," are plainly
distinctive from John's baptism. Saith Grotius,
<i>Sic accepere Latinus, Syrus, Arabs, et Veteres omnes
ante Marnixium (ut verba Lucæ)</i>. Yet I say not so
hardly of John's baptism, as Tertullian on this text,
(de Baptis.) <i>Adeo postea in Actis apostolorum invenimus,
quoniam qui Johannis baptismum habebant, non
accepissent Spiritum Sanctum, quem ne auditu quidam
noverant: ergo non erat cœleste, quod cœlestia non exhibebat.</i>

<h3>Quest. XLVII. <i>Is baptism by laymen or women lawful in cases of
necessity? Or are they nullities, and the person to be re-baptized.</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I. I know some of the ancients allowed it
in necessity. But I know no such necessity that can
be: for, 1. God hath expressly made it a part of the
ministerial office by commission, Matt. xxviii. 19,
20. 2. He hath no where given to any other either
command to oblige them to do it or commission to
authorize them, or promise to bless and accept them
in it, or threatening if they omit it. 3. He oft severely
punisheth such as invade the sacred function,
or usurp any part of it. 4. Therefore it is a sin in
the doer, and then there can be no necessity of it in
such a case in the receiver. 5. He that is in covenant
by open, professed consent, wants nothing necessary
to his salvation, either <i>necessitate medii vel
præcepti</i>, when it cannot be had in a lawful way.</p>

<p>II. As to the nullity, I will not determine so controverted
a point any further than to say, 1. That if
the layman had the counterfeit orders of a minister,
and had possession of the place, and were taken for
one, his deceit deprived not the receiver of his right,
nor made it his sin, and I should not re-baptize him,
if after discovered.</p>

<p>2. But if he were in no possession, or pretence of
the office, I would be baptized again, if it were my
case; because I should fear that what is done in
Christ's name by one that notoriously had no authority
from him to do it, is not owned by Christ as
his deed, and so is a nullity. As if a deceiver go in
my name to make bargains for me.</p>

<p>3. And if any that had after discovered a minister
to be indeed no minister that baptized him, should
doubt of the validity, and for certainty have it done
again by an authorized minister, I would not discommend
him: nor would I account it morally twice
baptizing, but a physical repeating of that act which
morally is but one (as I explained before of re-ordination).</p>

<p>Therefore if one that was a gross heretic in the
very essentials, or an infidel, or one that had not
knowledge and parts essentially necessary to the
ministry, baptize one, (in right words,) I would not
blame him that for certainty would have an authorized
person to do it; especially if he was notoriously
such a one when he did it. Let those that are
angry with this resolution be as fair to me as they
will be to Venerable Bede, and that great miracle-working
bishop John, whom in his ecclesiastical history
he reporteth to baptize a man again in England,
merely because the priest that did it was so dull, ignorant,
and insufficient as in John's judgment to be
uncapable of the office, and therefore had been by
him forbidden to use it, though the person baptized
(at age) knew not this:<span

<h3>Quest. XLVIII. <i>May anabaptists, that have no other error, be
permitted in church communion?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes: and tolerated in their own practice
also: for, 1. They agree with us in all points absolutely
necessary to communion.</p>

<p>2. The ancient christians had liberty either to
baptize, or to let them stay till age, as they thought
best; and therefore Tertullian and Nazianzen speak
against haste; and Augustine and many children of
christian parents were baptized at age.</p>

<p>3. The controversy is of so great difficulty, that
if in all such cases none that differ be tolerated, we
may not live together in the world or church, but
endlessly excommunicate or persecute one another.</p>

<p>4. Such sober antipædobaptists will consent, to
profess openly, that they do devote their children to
God according to all the power or duty which they
can find communicated or laid upon them in the word
of God; and that if they believed that God would
accept them into his covenant upon their dedication,
they would willingly do it. And that actually they
do offer them to God according to their power, and
promise to bring them up in his way. And who can
force men's wills to choose aright for themselves or
others?</p>

<h3>Quest. XLIX. <i>May one offer his child to be baptized, with the sign
of the cross, or the use of chrism, the white garment, milk and honey,
or exorcism, as among the Lutherans, who taketh these to be unlawful
things?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I am not now to meddle with the question,
whether they be lawful? but to this question I answer,</p>

<p>1. He that judgeth them unlawful, must first do
his best to be certain whether they be so or not.</p>

<p>2. If so, he must never approve of them, or consent
to them.</p>

<p>3. He must not offer his child to be so baptized,
when, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, he may have it done in a better
manner on lawful terms.</p>

<p>4. But when he cannot lawfully have better, he
may and must offer his child to them that will so
baptize him, rather than to worse, or none at all:
because baptism is God's ordinance and his privilege,
and the sin is the minister's, and not his. Another
man's sinful mode will not justify the neglect of our
duty; else we might not join in any prayer or sacrament
in which the minister modally sinneth; that
is, with none.</p>

<p>5. The milk and honey, white garment and chrism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">{664}</a></span>
are so ancient (called by Epiphanius and others the
traditions and customs of the universal church) that
the original of them is not known. And he that then
would not be so baptized, must not have been baptized
at all.</p>

<p>6. But in this case he that bringeth his child to
baptism, should make known, that it is baptism only
that he desireth; and that he disowneth and disalloweth
the manner which he accounteth sinful: and
then he is no consenter to it.</p>

<p>7. But where law, scandal, or great inconveniences
forbid him, he is not to make this profession openly
in the congregation, but in that prudent manner
which beseemeth a sober, peaceable person; whether
to the minister in private, or to his neighbours in
converse; it being easy among neighbours to make
known a man's dissent, without a disorderly troubling
of the church, or violating the laws of obedience,
civility, and peace.</p>

<p>8. But he must not, 1. Either offer his child to
baptism, where the ordinance is essentially corrupted,
or worse than none. 2. Or where he cannot be admitted
without an actual sin of his own; as by false
professions, subscriptions, &amp;c. For we must not do
evil for good ends.</p>

<h3>Quest. L. <i>Whence came the ancient universal custom of anointing at
baptism, and putting on a white garment, and tasting milk and honey?
And whether they are lawful to us?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. We must remember that the signification
of these was not by a new institution of theirs, but
by former custom of the countries where they lived.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_297" id="Ref_297" href="#Foot_297">[297]</a></span>
As, (1.) Anointing in Judea was like bathing at
Rome: it was taken in those scorching countries for
a wholesome, and easing, and comforting thing; and
therefore used to refresh the weary limbs of travellers,
and to comfort the sick.</p>

<p>(2.) And it was the long accustomed ceremony
also used on officers accounted sacred, kings and
priests, who were anointed at their entrance and investiture.</p>

<p>(3.) White clothing and purple were then and
there taken for the noblest attire;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_298" id="Ref_298" href="#Foot_298">[298]</a></span>
not appropriated
to sacred things and persons; but as scarlet lately
in England, the garb only of great men. On which
account, not as a sacred vestment, but as an honourable
clothing, when the bishops began to be advanced,
they were allowed to wear white clothing,
not only when they officiated, but at other times.</p>

<p>(4.) The milk and honey were there highly
esteemed for food, and accounted the character of
the land of promise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_299" id="Ref_299" href="#Foot_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Hereupon by application the churches used
these signs in the sacred ordinance of baptism: not
by new institution of the signification, I say, but by
application of the old well-known signification.</p>

<p>3. As natural signs are commonly allowed to be
applied to holy things, so signs whose signification
is of old and commonly stated and well known by
agreement or custom, do seem in this not to be different
from natural signs. Such are all words, as
signs of our minds; no word signifying any thing
naturally, but by agreement or custom only. And
such is kneeling in prayer, and being uncovered, and
many the like: about some of which Paul appealeth
to the custom of the churches of God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_300" id="Ref_300" href="#Foot_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>4. It is most probable that these two things together
brought in anointing: (1.) The common use of
anointing then, in both the foresaid cases (common
refreshment and sacred investiture). (2.) And the
mistake of all those Scripture texts, which command
or mention anointing metaphorical: as 1&nbsp;John ii. 27,
"The anointing which you have received&mdash;teacheth
you all things." Ezek. xvi. 9, "I washed thee, I
anointed thee with oil," &amp;c. Psal. cv. 15; 1&nbsp;Chron.
xvi. 22, "Touch not mine anointed." Rev. iii. 18.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_301" id="Ref_301" href="#Foot_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>And withal reading that we are made kings and
priests to God, and a royal priesthood, they thought
this might be signified by the usual honorary signs
of such, as well as by words to be called such. So
that they took it as if, in our age, the baptized should
be set in a chair of state, and sumptuously apparelled,
and a feast made to solemnize it, as they do at
weddings, and the baptized person set at the upper
end, &amp;c. which are significant actions and ceremonies;
but they intended them not as new sacraments,
or any part of the sacrament, but as a pompous
celebration of the sacrament by such additional ceremonial
accidents.</p>

<p>5. And you must remember that they lived among
infidels, where their profession was made the common
scorn, which tempted them by such ostentation
and pomp to seek to make it honourable, and to show
that they so accounted it, and to encourage those
who were discourageable by the scorn. On which
account also they used the cross, and the memorials
of the martyrs.</p>

<p>6. Yet some, yea, many afterwards did seem to
take the anointing for a sacramental action. When
they read that the laying on of hands was the sign
of giving the Holy Ghost, as distinct from baptism,
and that the Spirit is called in Scripture the anointing,
they joined both together, and made that which
they now called the sacrament of confirmation.</p>

<p>7. Whether the anointing, milk and honey, and
the white garment, were then sinful in themselves
to the users, I determine not. But certainly they
proved very ill by accident, whilst at this door those
numerous and unlawful ceremonies have entered,
which have so troubled the churches, and corrupted
religion; and among the papists, Greeks, Armenians,
Abassines, and many others, have made the sauce to
become the meat, and the lace to go for clothing,
and turned too much of God's worship into imagery,
shadows, and pompous shows.</p>

<h3>Quest. LI. <i>Whether it be necessary that they that are baptized in
infancy, do solemnly at age renew and own their baptismal covenant,
before they have right to the state and privileges of adult members?
And if they do not, whether they are to be numbered with christians or
apostates?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Church membership is the same thing in
infants and in the adult.</p>

<p>2. Infants are naturally uncapable of doing all that
in baptism which the adult must do; as to understand,
profess, &amp;c. themselves.</p>

<p>3. The baptism of the adult, being the most complete,
because of the maturity of the receivers, is
made the standing pattern in Scripture; for God
formeth his ordinances to the most perfect ordinary
receivers.</p>

<p>4. Though an infant be devoted acceptably to God
by his parent's will, yet when he is at age it must
be done by his own will.</p>

<p>5. Therefore a bare infant title ceaseth when we
come to age, and the person's title ceaseth, unless it
be renewed by himself, or his own consent. The
reason is, because the conditions of his infant title
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">{665}</a></span>
then cease: for his parent's will shall go for his
no longer.</p>

<p>6. Regularly and <i>ad bene esse</i> the transition out of
the state of infant membership into the state of
adult membership should be very solemn; and by an
understanding, personal owning of the baptismal
covenant.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_302" id="Ref_302" href="#Foot_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>7. There needeth no other proof of this, than,
1. That God in Scripture never gave adult persons
title to this covenant, but by their own personal
consent; and at the first institution of baptism, both
went together, (personal profession and baptism,)
because the receivers were adult. 2. And that infants
are capable of baptism, but not of personal
profession. 3. Therefore though they are not to
repeat baptism, which was done before, yet they are
bound to make that profession at age which they
never made before.</p>

<p>8. Where this solemn owning of their covenant
cannot be had, (by reason of church corruptions, and
magistrates' prohibition,) there the person's ordinary
joining with the church, in the public profession
and worship, is to be taken for an owning it.</p>

<p>9. He that being baptized in infancy, doth no way
at full age own his baptismal covenant, is to be
taken for an apostate: 1. Because his infant title
ceaseth. 2. And he notoriously violateth his covenant.
3. Because he can be no adult christian that no way
owneth Christ.</p>

<p>10. But this is to be understood of those that have
opportunity; for one in a wilderness among heathens
only, cannot join in public worship, nor give testimony
of his christianity to the church.</p>

<p>11. Though the sacrament of the Lord's supper
be appointed for the renewing of our covenant at
age, yet is it not the first owning of the covenant, by
the aged: for that sacrament belongeth neither to
infants nor infidels; and he that claimeth it, must be
an adult church member or christian; which those
are not, who at full age no way ever owned their
baptismal covenant, nor made any personal profession
of christianity.</p>

<p>But of this I have written purposely in a "Treatise
of Confirmation" long ago.</p>

<h3>Quest. LII. <i>Whether the universal church consist only of particular
churches and their members?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> No: particular churches are the most regular
parts of the universal church, but not the whole;
no more than cities and corporations be all the
kingdom. 1. Some may be, as the eunuch, baptized
before they can come to any particular church; or
as Paul, before they can be received.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_303" id="Ref_303" href="#Foot_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Some may live where church tyranny hindereth
them, by sinful impositions; as all that live among
the papists.</p>

<p>3. Some may live in times of doubting, distraction,
and confusion, and not know what church ordinarily
to join with, and may providently go promiscuously
to many, and keep in an unfixed state for a time.</p>

<p>4. Some may be wives, children, or servants, who
may be violently hindered.</p>

<p>5. Some may live where no particular churches
are; as merchants and ambassadors among Mahometans
and heathens.</p>

<h3>Quest. LIII. <i>Must the pastor first call the church, and aggregate
them to himself, or the church first congregate themselves, and then
choose the pastor?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The pastors are in order of nature, if not
in time, first ministers of Christ in general, before
they are related to a particular charge.</p>

<p>2. As such ministers, they first make men fit to be
congregate, and tell them their duty therein.</p>

<p>3. But it is a matter variable and indifferent,
whether the minister first say, All that will join
with me, and submit to me as their pastor, shall be
my particular charge; or the people before congregated
do call a man to be their pastor.</p>

<h3>Quest. LIV. <i>Wherein doth a particular church of Christ's
institution differ from a consociation of many churches?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. In that such particular church is a company
of christians associated for personal immediate
communion in God's worship and in holy living;
whereas consociations of churches are combined for
mediate distinct communion, or by delegates, or
representatives (as in synods).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_304" id="Ref_304" href="#Foot_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>2. Such a particular church is constituted of one
or more pastors with the people, officiating in the
sacred ministry among them, in doctrine, worship,
and discipline, in order to the said personal communion.
But a consociation of churches hath no particular
head as such, of divine institution, to constitute
and govern them as one. In Ignatius's time
every particular church was characterized or known
by two marks of unity: 1. One altar (that is, one
place of assembling for holy communion). 2. One
bishop with the presbyters and deacons: and two
altars and two bishops proved two churches.</p>

<p>3. A particular church under one bishop or the
same pastors, is a political, holy society; but a combination
of many churches consociate, is not so, but
only, 1. Either a community agreeing to live in concord,
as neighbour kingdoms may. 2. Or else a
human policy or society, and not of divine immediate
institution. So that if this consociation of
churches be called a church, it must be either equivocally
or in a human sense.</p>

xi. 26; James ii. 2.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. LV. <i>Whether a particular church may consist of more
assemblies than one? or must needs meet all in one place?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The true distinguishing note of a particular
church is, that they be associated for holy
communion in worship and holy living, not by delegates,
nor distantly only, by owning the same faith,
and loving one another, as we may do with those at
the antipodes; but personally in presence.</p>

<p>2. Therefore they must necessarily be so near, as
to be capable of personal, present communion.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_305" id="Ref_305" href="#Foot_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>3. And it is most convenient that they be no more
than can ordinarily meet in the same assembly, at
least for sacramental communion.</p>

<p>4. But yet they may meet in many places or assemblies,
as chapels, or oratories, or other subordinate
meetings, which are appointed to supply the
necessity of the weak and aged, and them that cannot
travel far. And in times of persecution, when
the church dare not at all meet in one place, they
may make up several smaller meetings, under several
pastors of the same church. But they should come
all together as oft as they can.</p>

<p>5. And it is to be considered that all the persons
of a family can seldom go to the assembly at one
time, especially when they live far off. Therefore
if a church place would receive but ten thousand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">{666}</a></span>
yet twenty thousand might be members, while half
meet one day and half another (or another part of
the day).</p>

<p>6. Two congregations distinctly associated for personal
worship, under distinct pastors, or having
statedly (as Ignatius speaketh) two bishops and two
altars, are two particular churches, and can no otherwise
be one church, than as that may be called one
which is a consociation of divers.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. LVI. <i>Is any form of church government of divine
institution?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yea: there are two essentially different
policies or forms of church government of Christ's
own institution, never to be altered by man. 1. The
form of the universal church, as headed by Christ
himself; which all christians own as they are christians
in their baptism.</p>

<p>2. Particular churches, which are headed by their
particular bishops or pastors, and are parts of the
universal, as a troop is of an army, or a city of a
kingdom.</p>

<p>Here it is of divine institution, 1. That there be
holy assemblies for the public worship of God.</p>

<p>2. That these assemblies be societies, constituted
of the people with their pastors, who are to them as
captains to their troops under the general, or as
mayors to cities under the king.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_306" id="Ref_306" href="#Foot_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>3. That these pastors have the power of the keys,
or the special guidance and governance (by the word,
not by the sword) of their own particular charge, in
the matters of faith, worship, and holy living; and
that the flocks obey them. And when all this is <i>jure
divino</i>, why should any say, that no form of government
is <i>jure divino</i>?</p>

<p>3. Moreover it is of divine appointment, that
these churches hold the nearest concord, and help
each other as much as they can; whether by synods,
or other meet ways of correspondency. And though
this be not a distinct government, it is a distinct mode
of governing.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But that there be pastors with fixed
churches or assemblies is not of the law of nature.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Hath Christ no law but the law of nature?
Wherein then differ the christian religion and the
heathenish? 2. Suppose but Christ to be Christ,
and man to be what he is, and nature itself will tell
us that this is the fittest way for ordering the worship
of God. For nature saith, God must be solemnly
and ordinarily worshipped, and that qualified persons
should be the official guides in the performance,
and that people who need such conduct and private
oversight besides, should where they live have their
own stated overseers.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But particular congregations are not <i>de
primaria intentione divina</i>: for if the whole world
could join together in the public worship of God, no
doubt that would be properly a church. But particular
congregations are only accidental, in reference
to God's intention of having a church, because of the
impossibility of all men's joining together for ordinances,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The question with me is not whether
they be of primary intention, but whether stated
churches headed with their proper bishops or pastors
be not of God's institution in the Scripture?</p>

<p>2. This objection confirmeth it, and not denieth
it. For, 1. It confesseth that there is a necessity of
joining for God's worship: 2. And an impossibility
that all the world should so join: 3. But if the whole
world could so join, it would be properly a church.
So that it confesseth that to be a society joined for
God's public worship, is to be properly a church. And
we confess all this: if all the world could be one
family, they might have one master; or one kingdom,
they might have one king. But when it is
confessed, that, 1. A natural impossibility of a
universal assembly necessitateth more particular assemblies;
2. And that Christ hath instituted such
actually in his word, what more can a considerate
man require?</p>

<p>3. I do not understand this distinction, <i>de primaria
intentione divina</i>, and accidental, &amp;c. The primary
intention is properly of the ultimate end only: and
no man thinketh that a law <i>de mediis</i>, of the means,
is no law, or that God hath made no laws <i>de mediis</i>:
for Christ as a mediator is a means. But suppose
it be limited to the matter of church laws; if this be
the meaning of it, that it is not the principal means,
but a subordinate means, or that it is not instituted
only <i>propter finem ultimum</i>, no more than <i>propter se</i>,
but also in order to a higher thing as its immediate
end, we make no question of that. Assemblies are
not only that there may be assemblies; but for the
worship and offices there performed: and those for
man; and all for God. But what of all this? Hath
God made no laws for subordinate means? No
christian denieth it.</p>

<p>Therefore the learned and judicious disputer of
this point declareth himself for what I say, when he
saith, I engage not in the controversy, Whether a
particular congregation be the first political church
or no? it sufficeth for my purpose, that there are
other churches besides.&mdash;The thing in question is,
Whether there be no other church but such particular
congregations? Where it seemeth granted that
such particular churches are of divine institution;
and for other churches I shall say more anon. In
the mean time note, that the question is but <i>de
nomine</i> here, whether the name church be fit for
other societies, and not <i>de re</i>.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_307" id="Ref_307" href="#Foot_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>But lest any should grow to the boldness to deny
that Christ hath instituted christian stated societies,
consisting of pastors and flocks, associate for personal
communion in public worship and holy living;
(which is my definition of a particular church, as
not so confined to one assembly, but that it may be
in divers, and yet not consisting of divers such distinct
stated assemblies with their distinct pastors,
nor of such as can have no personal communion,
but only by delegates;) I prove it thus from the
word of God.</p>

<p>(1.) The apostles were commissioned by Christ
to deliver his commands to all the churches, and settle
them according to his will, John xx. 21; Matt.
xxviii. 19, 20, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(2.) These commissioned persons had the promise
of an infallible Spirit for the due performance of
their work, John xvi. 13-15; xv. 26; xiv. 26;
Matt, xxviii. 20.</p>

<p>(3.) These apostles, wherever the success of the
gospel prepared them materials, did settle christian
stated societies, consisting of pastors or elders with
their flocks, associated for personal communion in
public worship and holy living. These settled
churches they gave orders to for their direction, and
preservation, and reformation: these they took the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">{667}</a></span>
chief care of themselves, and exhorted their elders
to fidelity in their work. They gave command that
none should forsake such assemblies; and they so
fully describe them, as that they cannot easily be
misunderstood. All this is proved, Acts xiv. 23;
Titus i. 5; Rom. xvi. 1; 1&nbsp;Cor. xi. 18, 20, 22, 26;
xiv. 4, 5, 12, 19, 23, 28, 33, 34; Col. iv. 16; Acts xi.
26; xiii. 1; 1&nbsp;Cor. xvi. 1, 2; Acts xiv. 27; xv. 3, to
omit many more. Here are proofs enow that such
particular churches were <i>de facto</i> settled by the
apostles. Heb. x. 25, "Forsake not the assembling of
yourselves together." So James ii. 2, they are called
synagogues.</p>

<p>2. It is confessed that there is a natural necessity
of such stated churches or assemblies, supposing
but the institution of the worship itself which is
there performed; and if so, then we may that the
law of nature itself doth partly require them.</p>

<p>(1.) It is of the law of nature, that God be publicly
worshipped, as most expositors of the fourth commandment
do confess.</p>

<p>(2.) It is of the law of nature that the people be
taught to know God and their duty, by such as are
able and fit to teach them.</p>

<p>(3.) The law of nature requireth, that man being
a sociable creature, and conjunction working strongest
affections, we should use our sociableness in the
greatest matters, and by conjunction help the zeal of
our prayers and praises of God.</p>

<p>(4.) God's institution of public preaching, prayer
and praise, are scarce denied by any christians.</p>

<p>(5) None of these can be publicly done but by
assembling.</p>

<p>(6.) No assembly can suffice for these without a
minister of Christ; because it is only his office to
be the ordinary teacher, and to go before the people
in prayer and praise, and to administer the Lord's
supper, which without a minister may not be celebrated,
because Christ's part cannot be otherwise
performed, than by some one in his name, and by
his warrant to deliver his sealed covenant to the receivers,
and to invest them visibly in the benefits of
it, and receive them that offer themselves in covenant
to him.</p>

<p>(7.) It is also a ministerial duty to instruct the
people personally, and to watch over them at other
times, Acts xx. 20, 28. And to be examples of the
flock, 1&nbsp;Pet. v. 1-3. To have the rule over the
people, and labour among them, and admonish them,
1&nbsp;Thess. v. 12; Heb. xiii. 7, 17; 1&nbsp;Tim. v. 17. To
exercise holy discipline among them, Titus iii. 10;
Matt. xviii. 17, 18; 1&nbsp;Cor. v. To visit the sick and
pray over them, James v. 14. Yea, to take care of
the poor. See Dr. Hammond on 1&nbsp;Cor. xii. 28.
And all this cannot possibly be well done by uncertain,
transient ministers, but only by a resident,
stated pastor, no more than transient strangers can
rule all our families, or all the christian kingdoms
of the world.</p>

<p>(8.) And as this cannot be done but by stated pastors,
so neither on transient persons ordinarily; for
who can teach them that are here to-day and gone
to-morrow? When the pastor should proceed from
day to day in adding one instruction to another, the
hearers will be gone, and new ones in their place.
And how can vigilancy and discipline be exercised
on such transient persons, whose faults and cases
will be unknown? Or how can they mutually help
each other? And seeing most in the world have
fixed habitations, if they have not also fixed church
relations, they must leave their habitations and wander,
or else have no church communion at all.</p>

<p>(9.) And as this necessity of fixed pastors and
flocks is confessed, so that such <i>de facto</i> were ordinarily
settled by the apostles, is before proved, if
any Scriptures may pass for proof.</p>

<p>The institution and settlement then of particular
worshipping churches is out of doubt. And so that
two forms of church government are <i>jure divino</i>, the
universal church form, and the particular.</p>

<p>4. Besides this, in the apostles' days there were
under Christ in the church universal, many general
officers that had the care of gathering and overseeing
churches up and down, and were fixed by stated
relation unto none. Such were the apostles, evangelists,
and many of their helpers in their days.
And most christian churches think that though the
apostolical extraordinary gifts, privileges, and offices
cease, yet government being an ordinary part of
their work, the same form of government which
Christ and the Holy Ghost did settle in the first
age, were settled for all following ages, though not
with the same extraordinary gifts and adjuncts. Because, <span
class="sni"><span class="hidev">|</span>Reasons for a larger episcopacy.<span
class="hidev">|</span></span>1. We read of the settling of that form,
(viz. general officers as well as particular,) but we never read
of any abolition, discharge, or cessation of the institution.
2. Because if we affirm a cessation without
proof, we seem to accuse God of mutability, as
settling one form of government for one age only,
and no longer. 3. And we leave room for audacious
wits accordingly to question other gospel institutions,
as pastors, sacraments, &amp;c. and to say that
they were but for one age. 4. It was general officers
that Christ promised to be with to the end of the
world, Matt. xxviii. 20.</p>

<p>Now either this will hold true or not. If not,
then this general ministry is to be numbered with
the human additions to be next treated of. If it do,
then here is another part of the form of government
proved to be of divine institution. I say not,
another church, (for I find nothing called a church
in the New Testament, but the universal church and
the particular,) but another part of the government
of both churches, universal and particular; because
such general officers are so in the universal, as to
have a general oversight of the particular; as an
army is headed only by the general himself, and a
regiment by the colonel, and a troop by the captain:
but the general officers of the army (the lieutenants-general,
the majors-general, &amp;c.) are under the lord-general
in and over the army, and have a general
oversight of the particular bodies (regiments and
troops). Now if this be the instituted form of
Christ's church government, that he himself rule
absolutely as general, and that he hath some general
officers under him, (not any one having a charge of
the whole, but in the whole unfixedly, or as they
voluntarily part their provinces,) and that each particular
church have its own proper pastor, (one or
more,) then who can say, that no form of church government
is of divine appointment or command?</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the question is only whether any sole
form be of God's commanding? And whether another
may not have as much said for it as this?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Either you mean another instead of this,
as a competitor, or, another part conjunct with these
parts.</p>

<p>1. If the first be your sense, then you have two
works to do. 1. To prove that these before mentioned
were mutable institutions, or that they were
settled but disjunctively with some other, and that the
choice was left indifferent to men. 2. To prove the
institution of your other form (which you suppose
left with this to men's free choice).</p>

<p>But I have already proved, that both the general
and particular church form are settled for continuance
as unchangeable ordinances of God. I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">{668}</a></span>
you doubt not of the continuance of Christ's
supremacy, and so of the universal form: and if you
will prove that church assemblies with their pastors
may cease, and some other way supply the room,
you must be strange and singular undertakers. The
other two parts of the government (by general officers,
and by consociation of churches) are more disputed;
but it is the circumstances of the last only that is
controverted, and not the thing; and for the other I
shall now add nothing to what I have said elsewhere.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_308" id="Ref_308" href="#Foot_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But if you only mean that another part of the
form may be <i>jure divino</i> as well as this, that will but
prove still that some form is <i>jure divino</i>.</p>

<p>But, 3. If you mean that God having instituted the
forms now proved, hath left man at liberty to add
more of his own, I shall now come to examine that
case also.</p>

<h3>Quest. LVII. <i>Whether any forms of churches, and church government,
or any new church officers, may lawfully be invented and made by
man?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> To remove ambiguities, 1. By the word
forms may be meant either that relative form of such
aggregate bodies which is their essence, and denominateth
them essentially; or only some accidental
mode which denominateth them but accidentally.</p>

<p>2. By churches is meant either holy societies related
by the foundation of a divine institution; or
else societies related by accident, or by human contract
only.</p>

<p>3. By church government is meant, either that
government formally ecclesiastical, which constituteth
a church, of Christ's making; or else some
government about the matters of the church, which
is formally either magistratical or human, (by contract,)
&amp;c.</p>

<p>4. So by church officers are meant, either such as
are accounted essential to a church in the pure christian
sense; or integral at least (as deacons); or else
such as are accounted but accidental to it, and essential
only to the human form. And so I answer,</p>

<p>1. As there are some things <i>circa sacra</i>, or accidents
of God's special church worship, which are
left to human prudence to determine of, so the same
human prudence may determine who shall do them.
As, e.&nbsp;g. Who shall repair the buildings of the church;
the windows, the bells, the pulpits, the tables, &amp;c.; who
shall keep the clock; who shall keep the cups, cloths,
and other utensils; who shall be the porter, the keeper
of the books, &amp;c.; who shall call the people to
church, or ring the bells, or give them notice of
church assemblies; who shall make the bread for the
sacrament, or provide wine, or bring water for baptism;
who shall make the graves, and bury the dead,
or attend marriages, or baptizings, &amp;c.; who shall
set the tune of the psalm, or use the church music
(if there be any); who shall summon any of the people
on any just occasion to come to their pastors; or who
shall summon the pastors to any synod, or lawful
assembly, and give them notice of the time and
place; when they are to meet, who shall be called
first, and who second; who shall sit highest, and
who lowest; who shall take the votes, or moderate
or guide the disputations of the assembly; who
shall be the scribe, and record what is done; who
shall send abroad their agreements, and who shall be
the church messenger to carry them. The agents
of such circumstantials maybe chosen by the magistrate,
or by the churches, or pastors, as is most convenient.
Though I doubt not but in the beginning
the deacons were mere servants to the pastors, to do
as much of such circumstantial work as they were
able; of which serving at tables, and looking to the
poor, and carrying bread and wine to the absent, &amp;c.
were but parts; and all went under the name of
ministering to the pastors or churches. And therefore
they seem to be such an accidental office, appointed
by the apostles, on such common reasons, as
magistrates or churches might have appointed them,
if they had not.</p>

<p>2. If one will call all or many of these, church
officers, and another will not, it is but a strife about
names, which one will use more largely and the
other more narrowly or strictly.</p>

<p>3. If magistrates by authority, or the churches by
agreement, shall distribute the country for conveniency
into parishes, (not making all to be church
members that dwell in those precincts, but determining
that all persons that are fit in those proximities,
and they only, shall be members of that particular
church,) and then shall denominate the church from
this accident of place, it is but what is left to their
discretion.</p>

<p>4. And if the said magistrates or churches shall
divide a kingdom into provinces, and say, that
whereas God commandeth us the use of correspondencies,
mutual advice, and synods, for the due help,
concord, and communion of churches, and all things
must be done in order and to edification; therefore
we determine that so many churches shall make up
such a synod, and the churches of such a district
shall make up another synod, and so shall be specially
related to each other for concord as advisers, all
this is but the prudent determining of church circumstances
or accidents left to man.</p>

<p>5. And if they shall appoint that either a magistrate
or one pastor shall be for order's sake the appointer
of the times and places of meeting, or the
president of the synod, to regulate and order proceedings,
and keep peace, as is aforesaid, it is but
an accident of the sacred work which man may determine
of. Therefore a layman may be such a
president or regulator.</p>

<p>6. And if they will call this man by the name of
a church governor, who doth but a common part
therein, and from thence will call this association or
province by the name of a church, which is but a
company of churches associated for concord and
counsel, the name maketh it not another thing than
it is without that name; and the name may be lawful
or unlawful as times and probable consequents make
it fit or unfit as to use.</p>

<p>7. So much of church matters as is left to the
magistrate's government, may be under monarchy,
aristocracy, or democracy, and under such subordinate
officers as the supreme ruler shall appoint.</p>

<p>8. And if the magistrate will make assemblies or
councils of pastors, to be his councils, and require
them frequently to meet to advise him in the performance
of his own trust and work about religion
and the church, he may accordingly distribute them
into provinces for that use, or order such circumstances
as he please.</p>

<p>9. And if a province of churches be called one
church, because it is under one magistrate, or a
nation of churches called a national church, because
it is under one king, or many kingdoms or an empire
called one catholic church, because they are all
under one emperor; it must be confessed that this
question is but <i>de nomine</i>, and not <i>de re</i>.</p>

<p>And further, 1. That in sacred things that which
is of divine and primary institution is the <i>famosius
analogatum</i>, and not that which is but formed by
man. 2. That when such an ambiguous word is
used without explication or explicating circumstances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">{669}</a></span>
it is to be taken for the <i>famosius analogatum</i>.
3. That in this case the word church or church form
is certainly ambiguous and not univocal. 4. That
a national, imperial, or provincial church as headed
by a king, emperor, magistrate, or any head of man's
appointment, is another thing from a church of
Christ's institution; and is but an accident or adjunct
of it: and the head of the human form, if
called the head of the church of Christ, is but an
accidental head, and not constitutive. And if Christ's
churches be denominated from such a head, they are
denominated but from an accident, as a man may be
denominated clothed or unclothed, clothed gorgeously
or sordidly, a neighbour to this man or that, &amp;c.
It is no formal denomination of a church in the first
acception, as it signifieth the <i>famosius analogatum</i>;
though otherwise many kind of societies may be
called <i>ecclesiæ</i> or <i>cœtus</i>: but divines should not love
confusion.</p>

<p>10. It seemeth to me that the first distribution of
churches in the Roman empire, into patriarchal,
primates, metropolitical, provincial, diocesan, were
only the determination of such adjuncts or extrinsic
things, partly by the emperors, and partly by the
church's consent upon the emperor's permission; and
so that these new church governments were partly
magistratical, or by power derived from the emperors,
and partly mere agreements or contracts by degrees
degenerating into governments; and so the new
forms and names are all but accidental, of adjuncts
of the true christian churches. And though I cannot
prove it unlawful to make such adjunctive or extrinsic
constitutions, forms, and names, considering the
matter simply itself, yet by accident these accidents
have proved such to the true churches, as the accident
of sickness is to the body, and have been the
causes of the divisions, wars, rebellions, ruins, and
confusions of the christian world. 1. As they have
served the covetousness and ambition of carnal men.
2. And have enabled them to oppress simplicity and
sincerity. 3. And because princes have not exercised
their own power themselves, nor committed it
to lay officers, but to churchmen. 4. Whereby the
extrinsic government hath so degenerated, and obscured
the intrinsic, and been confounded with it,
that both going under the equivocal name of ecclesiastical
government, few churches have had the
happiness to see them practically distinct.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_309" id="Ref_309" href="#Foot_309">[309]</a></span>
Nay,
few divines do clearly in their controversy distinguish
them. (Though Marsilius Patavinus and some few
more have formerly given them very fair light, yet
hath it been but slenderly improved.)</p>

<p>11. There seemeth to me no readier and directer
way, to reduce the churches to holy concord, and
true reformation, than for the princes and magistrates
who are the extrinsic rulers, to re-assume
their own, and to distinguish openly and practically
between the properly priestly or pastoral intrinsic
office, and their extrinsic part, and to strip the pastors
of all that is not intrinsically their own (it being
enough for them, and things so heterogeneous not
well consisting in one person): and then when the
people know what is claimed as from the magistrate
only, it will take off most of their scruples as to subjection
and consent.</p>

<p>12. No mortal man may abrogate or take down
the pastoral office, and the intrinsic, real power
thereof, and the church form which is constituted
thereby; seeing God hath instituted them for perpetuity
on earth.</p>

<p>13. But whether one church shall have one pastor
or many is not at all of the form of a particular
church; but it is of the integrity or gradual perfection
of such churches as need many, to have many,
and to others not so: not that it is left merely to the
will of man, but it is to be varied as natural necessity
and cause requireth.</p>

<p>14. The nature of the intrinsic office or power
(anon to be described) is most necessary to be understood
as distinct from the power of magistrates, by
them that would truly understand this. The number
of governors in a civil state make that which is called
a variety of forms of commonwealths, monarchy,
aristocracy, or democracy: because commanding
power is the thing which is there most notably exercised,
and primarily magnified. And a wiser and
better man, yea, a thousand, must stand by as subjects,
for want of authority or true power; which can be
but in one supreme, either natural or political person;
because it cannot consist in the exercise with
self-contradiction. If one be for war, and another
for peace, &amp;c. there is no rule. Therefore the many
must be one collective or political person, and must
consent or go by the major vote, or they cannot
govern. But that which is called government in
priests or ministers, is of another nature; it is but a
secondary subservient branch of their office: the first
parts are teaching and guiding the people, as their
priests, to God in public worship: and they govern
them by teaching, and in order to further teaching
and worshipping God; and that not by might, but by
reason and love. Of which more anon. Therefore
if a sacred congregation be taught and conducted in
public worship, and so governed as conduceth hereunto,
whether by one, two, or many, it no more
altereth the form of the church, than it doth the
form of a school, when a small one hath one schoolmaster,
and a great one four: or of an hospital, when
a small one hath one physician, and a great one
many; seeing that teaching in the one, and healing
in the other, is the main denominating work, to which
government is but subservient in the most notable
acts of it.</p>

<p>15. No mortal man may take on him to make
another church, or another office for the church, as a
divine thing, on the same grounds, and of the same
nature pretendedly as Christ hath made those already
made. The case of adding new church officers or
forms of churches, is the same with that of making
new worship ordinances for God, and accordingly to
be determined (which I have largely opened in its
place). Accidents may be added. Substantials of
like pretended nature may not be added; because it is
a usurping of Christ's power, without derivation by
any proved commission; and an accusing of him, as
having done his own work imperfectly.</p>

<p>16. Indeed no man can here make a new church
officer of this intrinsic sort, without making him new
work, which is to make new doctrine, or new worship
(which are forbidden): for to do God's work
already made belongs to the office already instituted.
If every king will make his own officers, or authorize
the greater to make the less, none must presume to
make Christ officers and churches without his commission.</p>

<p>17. No man must make any office, church, or
ordinance, which is corruptive or destructive, or contrary
or injurious to the offices, churches, and ordinances
which Christ himself hath made. This
Bellarmin confesseth, and therefore I suppose protestants
will not deny it. Those human officers
which usurp the work of Christ's own officers, and
take it out of their hands, do malignantly fight
against Christ's institutions: and while they pretend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">{670}</a></span>
that it is but preserving and not corrupting or opposing
additions which they make, and yet with these
words in their mouths, do either give Christ's officers'
work to others, or hinder and oppress his
officers themselves, and by their new church forms
undermine or openly destroy the old, by this expression
of their enmity they confute themselves.</p>

<p>18. This hath been the unhappy case of the Roman
frame of church innovations, as you may observe in
the particulars of its degeneracy.</p>

<p>(1.) Councils were called general or œcumenical in
respect to one empire only; and they thence grew to
extend the name to the whole world; when they
may as well say, that Constantine, Martian, &amp;c.
were emperors of the whole world, seeing by their
authority they were called.</p>

<p>(2.) These councils at first were the emperor's
councils called to direct him what to settle in church
orders by his own power; but they were turned to
claim an imposing authority of their own to command
the churches as by commission from God.</p>

<p>(3.) These councils at first were only for counsel,
or for agreement by way of contract or mutual consent
to the particular bishops; but they degenerated
into a form of government, and claimed a ruling and
commanding power.</p>

<p>(4.) The patriarchs, primates and metropolitans,
at first claimed but a power about circumstantials
extrinsical to the pastoral office, such as is the
timing and placing of councils, the sitting above
others, &amp;c. And the exercise of some part of the
magistrate's power committed to them, that is, the
deposing of other bishops or pastors from their
station of such liberty and countenance as the magistrate
may grant or deny as there is cause. But in
time they degenerated to claim the spiritual power
of the keys, over the other bishops, in point of ordination,
excommunication, absolution.</p>

<p>(5.) These patriarchs, primates, and metropolitans,
at first claimed their extrinsic power but from man,
that is, either the consent and agreement of the
churches, or the grant of the emperors: but in time
they grew to claim it as of divine or apostolical appointment,
and as unalterable.</p>

<p>(6.) At first they were taken only for adjuncts,
ornaments, supports, or conveniences to the churches:
but afterwards they pretended to be integral parts
of the church universal, and at last the pope would
needs be an essential part; and his cardinals must
claim the power of the church universal in being the
choosers of a universal head, or a king priest and
teacher for all the christians of the world.</p>

<p>(7.) At first laymen (now called chancellors, &amp;c.)
were only the bishops' counsellors, or officers to the
magistrate or them, in performing the extrinsical
work about church adjuncts, which a layman might
do: but at last they came to exercise the intrinsic
power of the keys in excommunications and absolutions,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>(8.) At first a number of particular churches consociated
with their several bishops, were taken to be
a community or company of true churches prudentially
cantonized or distributed and consociated for
concord; but after they grew to be esteemed proper
political societies, or churches of divine appointment,
if not the <i>ecclesia minimæ</i>, having turned the
particular churches into oratories or chapels, destroying
Ignatius's character of one church, To every
church there is one altar, and one bishop with his
presbyters and deacons. Abundance more such instances
may be given.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Wherever we find the notion of a church
particular, there must be government in that church;
and why a national society incorporated into one
civil government, joining into the profession of
christianity, and having a right thereby to participate
of gospel ordinances, in the convenient distributions
of them in the particular congregations, should
not be called a church, I confess I can see no reason.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Here observe, that the question is only
of the name, (whether it may be called a church,)
and not of the thing (whether all the churches in a
kingdom may be under one king, which no sober
man denieth).</p>

<p>2. Names are at men's disposal much; but I confess
I had rather the name had been used no otherwise,
or for no other societies, than Scripture useth
it. My reasons are, (1.) Because when Christ hath
appropriated or specially applied one name to the
sacred societies of his institution, it seemeth somewhat
bold to make that name common to other
societies. (2.) Because it tendeth to confusion, misunderstanding,
and to cherish errors and controversies
in the churches, when all names shall be made
common or ambiguous, and holy things shall not be
allowed any name proper to themselves, nor any
thing can be known by a bare name without a description.
If the name of Christ himself should be
used of every anointed king, it would seem not a little
thus injurious to him. If the name, Bible, Scripture,
preachers, &amp;c. be made common to all that the
notation of the names may extend to, it will introduce
the aforesaid inconveniences; so how shall we
in common talk distinguish between sacred societies
of divine institution and of human if you will allow
us no peculiar name, but make that common which
Christ hath chosen?</p>

<p>3. And that the name is here used equivocally is
manifest. For the body political is informed and
denominated from the <i>pars imperans</i>, the governing
part or head: therefore as a head of divine institution,
authorized for the spiritual or pastoral work,
denominateth the society accordingly; so a civil
head can make but a civil society, and a head of
man's making, but a human society. It is certain that
Christ hath appointed the episcopal or pastoral office,
and their work, and consequently episcopal or pastoral
churches; and it is certain that a king is no constitutive
part of one of these churches, but accidental;
and therefore that he is an accidental head to a pastoral
church as such, to which the pastor is essential.</p>

<p>Therefore if you will needs call both these societies
churches, you must distinguish them into pastoral
churches, and regal churches, or magistratical
churches; for the word national, notifieth not the
government which is the constitutive part; and may
be used of consociated churches, though under many
civil governors (as in the Saxon Heptarchy).</p>

<p>So that our question is much like this, Whether
all the grammar schools in England as under one
king may be called one national school? <i>Answ.</i>
Not without unfitness, and inconveniences; but rather
than breed any quarrel, they may call them so that
please: but, 1. They must confess that a particular
school is the <i>famosius significatum</i>. 2. That the king
is king of schools, but not a schoolmaster, nor a constitutive
part of a school. 3. That if you will needs
denominate them from the regent part, as one, you
must call them all one royal school, if you will leave
the well-known sense of words for such uncouth
phrases. But give us leave to call the body which
is essentiated by a king, by the name of a kingdom
only, though it have in it many schools, academies,
colleges, cities, churches, which they that please
may call all one royal school, academy, college, city,
and church, if they love confusion.</p>

<p>4. Christianity giveth men right to communion in
particular churches, when they also make known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">{671}</a></span>
their christianity to the bishops of those churches, and
are received (as stated or transient) members by
mutual consent; but not otherwise; nor doth mere
regal government give any subject right to church
communion, except by a church you mean a kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> A particular church then I would describe
thus, It is a society of men joined together in the
visible profession of the true faith, having a right
to, and enjoying among them, the ordinances of the
gospel.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. When you tell us by your description
what you will mean by a particular church, we may
understand your denomination; but yet while it is
unusual, you must not expect that other men so use
the word. Had you called your description a definition,
I would have asked you, 1. Whether by a society,
you mean not strictly a political society constituted
by a <i>pars gubernans, et gubernata</i>? If not, it
is no church save equivocally. If so, should not the
<i>pars regens</i> which is constitutive have been put in?
If private men join together, &amp;c. it makes but a
community. 2. A right to gospel ordinances is supposed,
but need not be in the definition. 3. The enjoying
of them, is not essential to a church. The
relation may continue, when the enjoyment is a long
time hindered. 4. Among them is a very ambiguous
word; is it among them in the same place; or in
the same country or kingdom; or in the same world?
If you difference and define them not, by relation to
the same bishops or pastors, and by intended personal
holy communion, your description confoundeth the
universal church, as well as the national, with a
particular church; for the whole christian world, is
a society of men joining together in the visible profession
of the true faith, having a right to, and enjoying
among them, the ordinances of the gospel.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> A nation joining in the profession of christianity
is a true church of God; whence it evidently
followeth, that there must be a form of ecclesiastical
government over a nation as a church, as well as of
civil government over it, as a society governed by
the same laws.&mdash;For every society must have its
government belonging to it as such a society; and
the same reason that makes government necessary in
any particular congregation, will make it necessary
for all the particular congregations, joining together
in one visible society, as a particular national church,
for the unity and peace of that church ought much
more to be looked after than any one particular congregation,
&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. From one absurdity many follow: our
controversy before was but of the name: if an accidental
royal or civil head may equivocally denominate
an ecclesiastical society, and we grant you the
use of an equivocal name, (or rather the abuse,) you
will grow too hard upon us, if thence you will gather
a necessity of a real ecclesiastical policy, besides the
civil. Names abused infer not the things signified
by an univocal term.</p>

<p>2. You must first prove the form of government,
and thence infer the denomination, and not, contrarily,
first beg the name, and then infer the government.</p>

<p>3. If yet by a form of ecclesiastical government,
you meant nothing but the king's extrinsic government,
which you may as well call also a form of
school government, of college government, &amp;c. we
would grant you all. But if I can understand you,
you now speak of ecclesiastical government as distinct
from that. And then,</p>

<p>4. You are now grown up from a may be, to a
must be, and necessity; and a greater necessity of
one national ecclesiastical government, than of a
particular church government; which being undeniably
of Christ's institution, (by the Holy Ghost in
the apostles,) you do not make all forms to be indifferent,
or deny this to be <i>jure divino</i>. What! necessary
and more necessary than that which is <i>jure divino</i>,
and yet indifferent and not <i>jure divino</i>? If you
say, It is necessary only on supposition that there
be a national church: I answer, But your reasons
evidently infer that it is also necessary that there be
such a national church where it may be had; though
you deny the necessity of monarchical government
by one high priest in it. But I know you call not
this a form of government, unless as determinately
managed by one, many or most. But why a national
spiritual policy as distinct from congregational, may
not be called a form of government, as well as one
man is distinct from two, over the same people, I see
not: but this is at your liberty. But your necessity
of such a national regimen is a matter of greater
moment.</p>

<p>In these three senses I confess a national church.
1. As all the christians in a nation are under one
civil church governor. 2. As they are consociated
for concord, and meet in synods or hold correspondences.
3. As they are all a part of the universal
church, cohabiting in one nation. But all
these are equivocal uses of the word church; the
denomination being taken in the first from an accident;
in the second the name of a policy being given
to a community agreeing for concord; in the third
the name of the whole is given to a small integral
part.</p>

<p>But the necessity of any other church, headed by
your ecclesiastical, national governor, personal or
collective, monarchical, aristocratical, or democratical,
I utterly deny, and find not a word of proof
which I think I have any need to furnish the reader
with an answer to.</p>

<p>5. And your judgment in this is downright against
the constitution, canons, and judgment of the national
church of England; for that they use the word in
the senses allowed by me, and not in yours, is proved,
(1.) From the visible constitution, in which there is
(besides the king) no distinct ecclesiastical head.
For the archbishop of Canterbury is not the proper
governor of the archbishop of York and his province.</p>

<p>(2.) From the canons. Can. cxxxix. "A national
synod is the church representative; whosoever shall
affirm that the sacred synod of this nation, in the
name of Christ and by the king's authority assembled,
is not the true church of England by representation,
let him be excommunicated," &amp;c. So that
the synod is but the representative church; and
therefore not the political head of the church:
whether it be the laity, or the whole clergy, or both,
which they represent, representation of those that are
no national head, maketh them not a national head.</p>

<p>(3.) From the ordinary judgment of episcopal divines,
(maintained by Bishop Bilson and many
others at large, against the papists,) that all bishops
<i>jure divino</i> are equal and independent, further than
human laws, or agreements, or difference of gifts
may difference them, or as they are bound to consociation
for concord.</p>

<p>6. How shall I deny not only the lawfulness, but
the necessity of such a papacy as really was in the
Roman empire, on your grounds? I have proved
against W. Johnson that the pope was then actually
but the head of the imperial churches, and not of
all the world. And if there must be one national
ecclesiastical head under one king, why not one also
in one empire? Or whether it be one monarch, or
a collective person, it is still one political person
which is now in question. (Either a ruling pope,
or a ruling aristocracy or democracy, which is not
the great matter in controversy.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">{672}</a></span>
7. And why will not the same argument carry it
also, for one universal visible head of all the
churches in the world? at least as lawful? at least
as far as human capacity and converse will allow?
And who shall choose this universal head? And
who can lay so fair a claim to it as the pope? And
if the form be indifferent, why may not the churches,
by consent at least, set up one man as well as many?
Whether you carry it to an imperial church, or a
papal, to a patriarchal, or provincial, or national, till
you have proved it to be of divine institution, (and
particular churches to be unnecessary, alterable, and
of human institution,) I shall never grant you that it
is to be preferred before that which is unquestionably
of God. For though I easily grant that all the
churches of a nation, empire, or the world, are to be
more esteemed and carefully preserved, than one
bishop's or pastor's particular church; yet I will not
grant you that your human policy is more necessary
to the safety of all these churches than the divine.
For the safety of these churches may be better preserved
by God's three great means, (1. The polity
of particular churches with the conduct of their present
faithful bishops or pastors. 2. The loving consociation
of neighbour churches for concord. 3. The
protection and countenance of magistrates,) without
any new church form, (or national, or imperial, or
universal pastor,) than with it.</p>

<p>Nay, when that sort of usurpation hath been the
very engine of dividing, corrupting, and undoing the
christian churches above a thousand years, we are
not easily persuaded now, that it is yet either necessary
or desirable.</p>

<p>8. But the best and easiest way to discern how
far the making new churches or church offices is
lawful or unlawful, is by trying it by the quality of
their office work. For it is the work which giveth
us the description of the office; and the office of the
ruling part, which giveth us the definition of the
church, which that office constituteth.</p>

<p>The work which the new human officer is to do,
is either, 1. The same which God hath already appointed
bishops or pastors to do, or at least the unfixed
ministers in the universal church. 2. Or it is
such as he hath appointed magistrates to do. 3. Or
it is such as belongeth to private and laymen. 4. Or
it is somewhat different from all these.</p>

<p>1. If it be of the first sort, it is a contradiction.
For men that are by office appointed to do the same
work which ministers are already appointed to do,
are not a new office, but ministers indeed, such as
Christ hath instituted: for the office is nothing but
an obligation and authority to do the work.</p>

<p>2. If it be the same work which belongeth to the
magistrate, then it is no new office, for they are
magistrates.</p>

<p>3. If it be that which belongeth to private men,
by God's appointment, they cannot disoblige themselves
by transferring it to a new officer.</p>

<p>4. If it be none of all these, what is it? I doubt
it may prove some needless or rather sinful work,
which God committed to none of these three sorts,
and therefore unfit to make a church office of. Unless
it be such as I before described and granted.
(1.) I confess that the magistrate may make new
inferior officers, to do his own part (as church
justices, churchwardens, &amp;c.) (2.) I grant that the
people may make an office for the better doing of
some parts of their own work: they may make collectors,
door-keepers, artists by office, to keep the
clock, and bells, and church buildings, &amp;c. if the
magistrates leave it to them.</p>

<p>(3.) I grant that the bishops or pastors may do
some circumstances of their work by human officers;
as to facilitate their concord in synods, by choosing
one to preside, to choose time and place, to send
messengers to take votes, to moderate disputes, to
record agreements, &amp;c. as aforesaid; and these
circumstantials are the things that officers may be
made for.</p>

<p>But the very modes and circumstances which are
part of the work to which every bishop or pastor is
obliged, he cannot commit to another; as to choose
his text, subject, method, words, &amp;c. These are
parts of his own work; though concord in these is
the work of many.</p>

<p>Now what is the work besides all these that we
must have new churches and offices made for? Is it
to govern all these bishops and churches? How?
By the word or by the sword? If by the sword, the
magistrate is to do it; if by the word, (or spiritual
authority,) either God hath made such an office as
archbishops or general bishops over many, or he
hath not: if he have, we need no new human office
for it, God having provided for it already; if not, but
God hath left all bishops independent, and to learn
of one another, as equal in office, and unequal only
in gifts, then either such an office is fit and necessary,
or not. If it be, you accuse God of omission
in not appointing a bishop over bishops as well as a
bishop of the lowest order. If not, then by what
reason or power will you make new needless officers
in the church? when Cyprian and his Carthage
council so vehemently disclaimed being <i>Episcopi
Episcoporum</i>?</p>

<p>19. I would fain know whether those new-made
churches of human and not of divine fabrication,
(whether universal, (or papal,) patriarchal, provincial,
&amp;c.) were made by former churches, or by no
churches. If by no churches, then either by other
societies or by single persons: if by other societies,
by what power do they make new churches to
Christ, who are themselves no churches? If by
single persons, either they are before church members,
or not; if not, how can those make new
churches that be not so much as members of churches,
without a commission from Christ? But if either
former churches or their members made these new
churches, then, (1.) It followeth that there were
another sort of churches before these new or human
churches. And if so, either those other that made
these were themselves made of God or not. And so
the question will run up till you bring it either to
some church of God's making which made these
other, or some person commissioned to do it. If you
say the first, then he that will confess that there is
a species of churches of Christ's institution, and a
species not of his institution, must prefer the former,
and must well prove the power of making the latter.
And so they must do, if they say that it was done by
particular persons that were no particular church
members. For if Christ commissioned them to settle
any one species of churches, those are to be esteemed
settled by Christ. (2.) But if you say that Christ
left them to vary the species of churches as they
saw cause, and so on to the end of the world, 1. You
must well prove it. 2. It is before disproved (unless
you take the word church equivocally).</p>

<p>20. Lastly, all christians are satisfied of Christ's
authority; and therefore in that they can agree:
but so they are not of any human church maker's
authority; and therefore in that there will never be
an agreement: therefore such new churches, and
ecclesiastical governments, will be but (as they ever
have been) the engines of division and ruin in the
churches; and the species of God's making, with
the mutability of mutable adjuncts and circumstances,
will best preserve the church's peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">{673}</a></span>
But if the true nature of pastoral or ecclesiastical
government were well understood, it would put an
end to all these controversies. Which may be mostly
gathered from what is said before. To which I will
add this little following.</p>

<p>Quest. <i>Wherein consisteth the true nature of pastoral church
government?</i></p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Not in any use of the sword, or corporal
force.</p>

<p>2. Not in a power to contradict God's word.</p>

<p>3. Not in a power co-ordinate with Christ's, to do
his proper work, or that which hath the same
grounds, reasons, and nature.</p>

<p>4. Not in an unquestionable empire, to command
things which none must presume to examine, or
judge of by a discerning judgment, whether they be
forbidden by God or not.</p>

<p>5. Not now in making a new word of God, or new
articles of faith, or new universal laws, for the whole
church.</p>

<p>6. Not in any thing which derogates from the
true power of magistrates, or parents, or masters.</p>

<p>But, 1. It is a ministerial power, of a messenger
or servant, who hath a commission to deliver his
master's commands and exhortations.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_310" id="Ref_310" href="#Foot_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>2. As it is over the laity or flocks, it is a power in
the sacred assemblies to teach the people by office,
and to be their priests or guides in holy worship;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_311" id="Ref_311" href="#Foot_311">[311]</a></span>
and to rule the worship actions for the time, length,
method, and orderly performance of them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_312" id="Ref_312" href="#Foot_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>3. As to particular persons, it is the power of the
church keys, which is, 1. To judge who is meet to
be by baptism taken into the church. 2. To reprove,
exhort, and instruct those that by vice or ignorance,
in order to repentance, or knowledge, or confirmation,
do need the pastoral help.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_313" id="Ref_313" href="#Foot_313">[313]</a></span>
3. To judge who is
to be forbidden church communion as impenitent;
or at least, with whom that church must be forbidden
to communicate. 4. To judge who is meet for
absolution as a penitent. 5. To deliver men personally
a sealed pardon from Christ in his two
sacraments. 6. To visit the sick, and comfort the
sad, and resolve the doubting, and help the poor.
This is the true church government, which is like a
philosopher's or schoolmaster's in his school among
volunteers, supposing them to have no power of the
rod or violence, but only to take in or put out of their
schools: and what need is there of a universal,
patriarchal, or national head, to do any of this work,
which is but the government of a personal teacher
and conductor; and which worketh only on the
conscience?</p>

<p>4. But besides this there is a necessity of agreeing
in the right management of this work; which
needeth no new head, but only the consultations of
the several bishops or pastors, and the magistrate's
civil rule, or extrinsic episcopacy (as Constantine
called it).</p>

<p>5. And besides this there is need to ordain pastors
and bishops in the church. And this is not done by
any force neither; but, 1. By judging what men
are fit; 2. By persuading the people to consent and
receive them; and, 3. By investing them by a delivery
of possession by the imposition of hands. Now
for all this, there needs no human species of bishops
or churches to be made.</p>

<p>6. Besides this there is need of some oversight of
these pastors and ministers and fixed bishops when
they are made; and of some general care of pastors
and people, if they decline to heresies, errors, vices,
or lukewarmness: but for this, 1. When magistrates
have done their part; 2. And neighbour ministers
to one another; 3. And the consociated bishops to
the particular ones; 4. And unfixed ministers have
done their parts in the places where occasionally
they come; if moreover any general pastors or archbishops
are necessary, to rebuke, direct, and persuade
the bishops or their flocks, by messengers,
epistles, or in presence, no doubt but God hath appointed
such as the successors of the apostles, evangelists,
and other general ministers of those first
times. But if no such thing be appointed by Christ,
we may be sure it is not necessary nor best.</p>

<p>If it were but considered that the ruling power in
the church is so inseparable from the teaching
power, that it is exercised by teaching and only by
God's word, (either generally or personally applied,)
and that upon none but those that willingly and by
consent receive it, it would quiet the world about
these matters. And oh that once magistrates would
take the sword wholly to themselves, and leave church
power to work only by its proper strength and virtue,
and then all things would fall into joint again;
though the Ithacians would be displeased.</p>

<h3>Quest. LVIII. <i>Whether any part of the proper pastoral or episcopal
power may be given or deputed to a layman, or to one of any other
office, or the proper work may be performed by such?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Such extrinsical, or circumstantial, or
accidental actions as are afore-mentioned may be
done by deputies or others (as calling the church together,
summoning offenders, recording actions, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>2. The proper episcopal or pastoral work or office
cannot be deputed, in whole or part, any other way
than by communication, which is, by ordination, or
making another to be of the same office. For if it
may be done by a layman, or one that is not of the
same order and office, then it is not to be called any
proper part of the pastoral or episcopal office: if a
layman may baptize, or administer the sacrament of
Christ's body and blood, or may ordain, or excommunicate,
(ecclesiastically,) or absolve, merely because
a bishop authorizeth or biddeth him, then,
1. What need Christ have made an office work of
it, and persons be devoted and consecrated to it?</p>

<p>2. And why may not the people's election and
the king's commission serve to enable a layman to
do it? For if commanding only be proper to the
bishop or pastor, and executing be common to laymen,
it is certain that the king may command all
bishops and pastors to do their office work; and
therefore he may command a layman to do that
which a bishop may command him to do.</p>

<p>3. And is it not a contradiction to say that a man
is a layman or of another order, who is authorized
by a bishop to do a bishop's work or office? when
as the office itself is nothing (as is oft said) but an
obligation and authority to do the work. If therefore
a bishop authorize and oblige any other man to
do the proper work of a bishop or pastor, (to ordain,
to baptize, to give the sacrament of the eucharist,
to excommunicate, to absolve, &amp;c.) he thereby
maketh that man a bishop or a pastor, whatever he
call him.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But doth not a bishop preach <i>per alios</i>, to
all his diocess? and give them the sacraments <i>per
alios</i>, &amp;c.?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Let not the phrase be made the controversy
instead of the matter. Those other persons
are either ministers of Christ, or laymen. If laymen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">{674}</a></span>
their actions are unlawful. If ministers, they
are commissioned officers of Christ themselves, and
it is the work of their own office which they do, and
it is they that shall have the reward or punishment.
But if preaching to all these churches, or giving to
all these persons in a thousand parishes the sacraments,
&amp;c. were the bishops' or archbishops' work,
that is, which they are obliged to do, then they
would sin in not doing it. But if they are the
governors only of those that are obliged to do it,
and are not obliged to do it themselves, then governing
the doers of it is only their work; and therefore
it is but equivocally said that the work is theirs,
which others and not they are obliged to do; and
that they do their work <i>per alios</i>, when they do but
govern those others in doing their own work.</p>

<p>Of this read the Lord Bacon's "Considerations,"
and Grotius "de Imper. summ. Potest. circa Sacra,"
who soundly resolve the case, against doing the pastoral
work <i>per alium</i>.</p>

<h3>Quest. LIX. <i>May a layman preach or expound the Scriptures? Or what
of this is proper to the pastor's office?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. No doubt but there is some preaching
or teaching and expounding which a layman may
use. So did Origen; so did Constantine; so may a
king, or judge on the bench; so may a parent to his
children, and a master to his family, and a schoolmaster
or tutor to his scholars.</p>

<p>2. It is not any one method or sermon fashion
which is proper to a minister and forbidden to a
layman; that method which is most meet to the
matter and hearers, may be used by one as well as
by the other.</p>

<p>3. It is not the mere publicness of the teaching,
which must tell us what is unlawful for a layman.
For writing and printing are the most public ways
of teaching; and these no man taketh to be forbidden
the laity. Scaliger, Casaubon, Grotius, Erasmus,
Constantine, King James, the Lord Bacon, and
abundance more laymen, have done the church great
service by their writings. And judges on the bench
speak oft theologically to many.</p>

<p>But that which is proper to the ministers or pastors
of the church is, 1. To make a stated office of
it, and to be separated, set apart, devoted, or consecrated
and appropriated to this sacred work; and
not to do it occasionally only, or sometimes, or on
the by; but as their calling and the employment of
their lives.</p>

<p>2. To do it as called and commissioned ministers
of Christ, who have a special nunciative and teaching
authority committed to them; and therefore are
in a special manner to be heard, according to their
special authority.</p>

<p>3. To be the stated teachers of particular churches,
as their pastors and guides (though they may sometimes
permit a layman when there is cause to teach
them <i>pro tempore</i>). These three are proper to the
ministerial and pastoral office.</p>

<p>But for the regulating of laymen's teaching, 1.
They must statedly keep in their families, or within
their proper bounds.</p>

<p>2. They must not presume to go beyond their
abilities, especially in matters dark and difficult.</p>

<p>3. They must not thrust themselves without a just
call and need into public or numerous meetings as
teachers, nor do that which savoureth of pride or ostentation,
or which tendeth to cherish those vices in
others.</p>

<p>4. They must not live or preach, as from under
the government of the church pastors; but being
members of their flocks, must do all as under their
lawful oversight and guidance: much less must they
proudly and schismatically set up themselves against
their lawful pastors, and bring them into contempt
to get themselves reputation, and to draw away disciples
after them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_314" id="Ref_314" href="#Foot_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>5. Times and places must be greatly distinguished.
In infidel or grossly ignorant countries, where through
the want of preachers there is a true necessity, men
may go much further than in countries where teachers
and knowledge do abound.</p>

<h3>Quest. LX. <i>What is the true sense of the distinction of pastoral
power, in foro interiore et exteriore, rightly used?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Not as if the pastors had any power of
the sword or outward force, or of men's bodies or
estates immediately: for all the pastoral power is
immediately on the soul, and but secondarily on the
body, so far as the persuaded soul will move it. Reason
and love, and the authority of a messenger of
Christ, are all the power by which bishops or pastors
as such can work, <i>in foro interiore vel exteriore</i>;
they rule the body but by ruling the soul.</p>

<p>2. But the true use of the distinction is only to
serve instead of the usual distinction of public and
personal obligation. It is one thing to satisfy a
man's private conscience about his own personal case
or matters; and another thing to oblige the whole
church, or a particular person, of his duty as a member
of the society to the rest. When the pastor absolveth
a penitent person, <i>in foro interiore</i>, that is, in
his own conscience, he delivereth him a discharge
in the name of Christ on condition he be truly
penitent; else not. But <i>in foro exteriore</i> he actually
and absolutely restoreth him to his visible state of
church communion. The rest of the members perhaps
may justly think this man unlike to prove a
true penitent; and then <i>in foro interiore</i> they are not
bound to believe him certainly penitent or pardoned
by God; but <i>in foro exteriore</i> that he is restored to
church communion, and that for order's sake they are
bound to hold communion with him, they are bound
(internally) to believe. So that it comes near the
sense of the distinction of the secret judgment (of
God and conscience) and church judgment.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXI. <i>In what sense is it true that some say, that the
magistrate only hath the external government of the church, and the
pastors the internal?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Not as external and internal are opposed
in the nature of the action. For the voice of the
pastor in preaching is external, as well as the king's.</p>

<p>2. Not as they are opposed in the manner of reception.
For the ears of the auditors are external
recipients from the preacher as well as from the
king.</p>

<p>3. Not as distinguishing the parts that are to obey,
the duties commanded, and the sins forbidden, as if
the king ruled the body only and the pastor the soul.
For the soul is bound to obey the king, or else the
body could not be bound to obey him; unless by
cords. And the body must obey the preacher as
well as the soul. Murder, drunkenness, swearing,
lying, and such other external vices, are under the
pastor's power to forbid in Christ's name, as well as
the king's.</p>

<p>4. Not as if all the external parts or actions of religion
were exempted from the pastor's power. For
preaching, praying, reading, sacraments, church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">{675}</a></span>
assemblies, are external parts of religion, and under
the pastor's care.</p>

<p>But in two respects the external power is only the
king's or civil magistrate's. 1. As it is denominated
from the sword, or mulcts, or corporal penalties,
which is the external means of execution; though
in this respect the distinction were far more intelligibly
expressed by, The government by the sword,
and by the sacred word.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_315" id="Ref_315" href="#Foot_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But the principal sense of their distinction is
the same with Constantine's, who distinguished of a
bishop without and within; or of our common distinction
of intrinsic and extrinsic government. And
though internal and external have the same signification,
use maketh intrinsic and extrinsic more intelligible.
And by internal is meant that power
which intrinsically belongeth to the pastor's office
as instituted by Christ; and so is intrinsical to the
pastorship and the church (as preaching, praying,
sacraments, the keys of admission and exclusion,
ordination, &amp;c.). And by external is meant, that
which is extrinsical to the pastorship and the church;
which princes have sometimes granted them, but
Christ hath made no part of their office. In this
sense the assertion is good, and clear, and necessary;
that the disposal of all things <i>circa sacra</i>, all accidents
and circumstances whatsoever, which by
Christ's institution are not intrinsical to the pastorship
and church, but extrinsical, do belong to the
power of kings and magistrates.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_315" id="Foot_315" href="#Ref_315">[315]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
As Bishop Bilson of Obed. useth still to distinguish them;
with many others. See B. Carlton of Jurisdiction.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. LXII. <i>Is the trial, judgment, or consent of the laity
necessary to the admittance of a member into the universal or
particular church?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is the pastor's office to bear and exercise
the keys of Christ's church; therefore by office
he is to receive those that come in; and consequently
to be the trier and judge of their fitness.</p>

<p>2. It belongeth to the same office which is to baptize,
to judge who is to be baptized; otherwise ministers
should not be rational judges of their own actions,
but the executioners of other men's judgment.
It is more the judging who is to be baptized, which
the minister's office consisteth in, than in the bare
doing of the outward act of baptizing.</p>

<p>3. He that must be the ordinary judge in church
admissions, is supposed to have both ability and leisure
to make him fit; and authority and obligation
to do the work.</p>

<p>4. The ordinary body of the laity have none of all
these four qualifications, much less all. 1. They are
not ordinarily able, so to examine a man's faith and
resolution with judgment and skill, as may neither
tend to the wrong of himself nor of the church; for
it is great skill that is required thereunto. 2. They
have not ordinarily leisure from their proper callings
and labours, to wait on such a work as it must be
waited on, especially in populous places. 3. They
are not therefore obliged to do that which they cannot
be supposed to have ability or leisure for. 4.
And where they have not the other three, they can
have no authority to do it.</p>

<p>5. It is therefore as great a crime for the laity to
usurp the pastor's office in this matter, as in preaching,
baptizing, or other parts of it.</p>

<p>6. And though pride often blind men (both people
and pastors) so as to make them overlook the burden
and look only at the authority and honour; yet is it
indeed an intolerable injury to the laity, if any
would lay such a burden on them which they
cannot bear, and consequently, would make them
responsible for the omissions or misdoing of it, to
Christ their Judge.</p>

<p>7. There is not so much as any fair pretence for
the laity having power to judge who shall be received
into the universal church; for who of the
laity should have this power? Not all, nor the
major vote of the church; for who ever sought the
votes of all the christians in the world, before he
baptized a man? Not any one particular church or
persons above the rest; for they have no right to
show for it, more than the rest.</p>

<p>8. It is not in the power of the laity to keep a
man out of their own particular church communion,
whom the pastor receiveth; because, as is said, it
is his office to judge and bear the keys.</p>

<p>9. Therefore, if it be ill done, and an unworthy
person be admitted, the consciences of the people
need not accuse themselves of it, or be disturbed,
because it is none of their employment.</p>

<p>10. Yet the liberty of the church or people, must
be distinguished from their governing power, and
their executing duty, from the power of judging.
And so, 1. The people are to be guided by the pastors
as volunteers, and not by violence: and therefore
it is the pastor's duty, in all doubtful cases, to
give the people all necessary satisfaction, by giving
them the reasons of his doings, that they may understandingly
and quietly obey and submit. 2. And
in case the people discern any notable appearance
of danger, by introducing heretics and grossly impious
men to corrupt the church, and by subverting
the order of Christ, they may go to their pastors to
desire satisfaction in the case. 3. And if by open
proof or notoriety it be certain, that by ignorance,
fraud, or negligence, the pastors thus corrupt the
church, the people may seek their due remedy from
other pastors and magistrates. 4. And they may
protest their own dissent from such proceedings. 5.
And in case of extremity, may cast off heretical, and
impious, and intolerable pastors, and commit their
souls to the conduct of fitter men; as the churches
did against the Arian bishops, and as Cyprian declareth
it his people's duty to do; as is aforesaid.<span

<h3>Quest. LXIII. <i>What power have the people in church censures and
excommunication?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This is here adjoined, because it requireth
but little more than the foregoing answer. 1. As it
is the pastor's office to judge who is to be received,
so also to judge who is to be excluded.</p>

<p>2. But the execution of his sentence belongeth to
the people as well as to himself. It is they that either
hold communion with the person, or avoid him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_317" id="Ref_317" href="#Foot_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Therefore though ordinarily they must acquiesce
in the pastor's judgment, yet if he grossly offend
against the law of God, and would bring them, e.&nbsp;g.
to communion with heretics and openly impious, and
excommunicate the orthodox and godly, they may
seek their remedy as before.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXIV. <i>What is the people's remedy in case of the pastor's
mal-administration?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This also is here annexed for despatch, as
being almost sufficiently answered already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">{676}</a></span>
It must be supposed that all church disorders
and mal-administrations cannot be expected to be
remedied; but many while we are sinners and imperfect
must be borne.</p>

<p>1. The first remedy is to speak submissively to
the pastor of his faults, and to say to Archippus,
"Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_318" id="Ref_318" href="#Foot_318">[318]</a></span>
And if he hear not more privately, for
the people more openly to warn and entreat him;
not as his governors, but as christians that have
reason to regard Christ's interest and their own, and
have charity to desire his reformation.</p>

<p>2. The next remedy is, to consult with the
neighbour pastors of other churches, that they may
admonish him; not as his governors, but as neighbour
pastors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_319" id="Ref_319" href="#Foot_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The next remedy is to seek redress from those
governors that have the power to correct or cast out
the intolerable.</p>

<p>4. The last remedy is that of Cyprian, to desert
such intolerable pastors.</p>

<p>But in all this, the people must be sure that they
proceed not proudly, ignorantly, erroneously, passionately,
factiously, disorderly, or rashly.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXV. <i>May one be a pastor or a member of a particular church,
who liveth so far from it, as to be uncapable of personal communion
with them?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The name is taken from the relation; and
the relation is founded in capacity, right, and obligation
to actual communion, duties, and privileges: 1.
He that is so statedly distant is uncapable statedly
of communion, and therefore uncapable of the relation
and name.</p>

<p>2. He that is but for a time accidentally so distant,
is but for that time uncapable of communion with
them; and therefore retaineth capacity, right, and
obligation statedly for the future, but not for the
present exercise. Therefore he retaineth the relation
and name, in respect to his future intended exercise;
but not in so plenary a sense, as he that is
capable of present communion.</p>

<p>3. It is not the length or shortness of the time of
absence that wholly cutteth off or continueth the
relation and name, but the probability or improbability
of a seasonable accession. For if a man be removed
but a day, with a purpose to return no more,
his relation ceaseth. And if a man be long purposing
and probably like to return, and by sickness or
otherwise be hindered, it doth not wholly end his
relation.</p>

<p>4. If the delay be so long as either maketh the
return improbable, or as necessitated the church to
have another statedly in the pastor's place, where
they can have but one, and so the people by taking
another, consent (though with grief) to quit their
relation and title to the former, there the relation is
at an end.</p>

<p>5. It is a delusory formality of some, that call
themselves members of a separated (or other) church,
from which they most ordinarily and statedly live
at an utter distance, and yet take themselves to be
no members of the church where they live, and
usually join with: and all because they covenanted
with one and not with the other.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXVI. <i>If a man be injuriously suspended or excommunicated by
the pastor or people, which way shall he have remedy?</i></h3>

<p><i>Ans.</i> As is aforesaid in case of mal-administration;
1. By admonishing the pastor or those that wrong
him. 2. By consulting neighbour pastors, that they
may admonish him. 3. By the help of rulers, where
such are, and the church's good forbids it not. 4.
In case of extremity, by removing to a church that
will not so injure you. And what needs there any
more, save patience?</p>

<h3>Quest. LXVII. <i>Doth presence always make us guilty of the errors or
faults of the pastor in God's worship, or of the church? Or in what
cases are we guilty?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. If it always made us guilty, no man
could join with any pastor or church in the world,
without being a wilful sinner. Because no man
worshippeth God without sin, in matter or manner,
omission or commission.</p>

<p>2. If it never made us guilty, it would be lawful
to join with Mahometans and bread-worshippers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Therefore the following decision of the question,
In what cases it is a duty or a sin to separate, doth
decide this case also. For when separation is
no duty, but a sin, there our presence in the worship
is no sin; but when separation is a duty, there our
presence is a sin.</p>

<p>4. Especially in these two cases our presence is a
sin: 1. When the very assembly and worship is so
bad as God will not accept, but judgeth the substance
of it for a sin. 2. In case we ourselves be put upon
any sin in communion, or as a previous condition of
our communion (as to make some false profession,
or to declare our consent to other men's sin, or to
commit corporal, visible, reputative idolatry, or the
like). But the pastor and church shall answer for
their own faults, and not we, when we have cause to
be present, and make them not ours by any sinful
action of our own.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXVIII. <i>Is it lawful to communicate in the sacrament with
wicked men?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The answer may be gathered from what is
said before.</p>

<p>1. If they be so wicked for number, and flagitiousness,
and notoriety, as that it is our duty to forsake
the church, then to communicate with them is a sin.
Therefore the after-resolution of the just causes of
separation must be perused. As if a church were
so far defiled with heresy, or open impiety, that it
were justified by the major vote, and bore down faith
and godliness, and the society were become uncapable
of the ends of church association and communion:
in this and other cases it must be deserted.</p>

<p>2. If we do not perform our own duty to remove
unlawful communions, (whether it be by admonition
of the offender or pastor, or whatever is proved
really our duty,) the omission of that duty is our sin.</p>

<p>3. But if we sin not by omitting our own duty, it
will be no sin of ours to communicate with the
church, where scandalous sinners or heretics are
permitted. The pastor's and delinquent's sins are
not ours.</p>

<p>4. Yea, if we do not omit our own duty in order
to the remedy, that will justify us in denying communion
with the church while wicked men are there.
But it will rather aggravate our sin, to omit one duty
first, and thence fetch occasion to omit another.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXIX. <i>Have all the members of the church right to the Lord's
table? And is suspension lawful?</i></h3>

<p>Of this see the defence of the synod's propositions in New England. I
answer,</p>

<p>1. You must distinguish between a fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">{677}</a></span>
right of state, and an immediate right of present
possession; or if you will, between a right duly to
receive the sacrament, and a right to immediate reception
simply considered.</p>

<p>2. You must distinguish between a questioned,
controverted right, and an unquestioned right; and
so you must conclude as followeth.</p>

<p>(1.) Every church member (at least adult) as such,
hath the fundamental right of stated relation, or a
right duly to receive the sacrament; that is, to receive
it understandingly and seriously at those seasons
when by the pastors it is administered.</p>

<p>(2.) But if upon faults or accusations, this right
be duly questioned in the church, it is become a controverted
right; and the possession or admission
may, by the bishops or pastors of the church, be suspended,
if they see cause, while it is under trial, till
a just decision.</p>

<p>3. Though infants are true members, yet the want
of natural capacity duly to receive maketh it unlawful
to give them the sacrament, because it is to be
given only to receivers, and receiving is more than
eating and drinking; it is consenting to the covenant,
which is the real receiving in a moral sense, or
at least consent professed. So that they want not a
state of right, as to their relation, but a natural
capacity to receive.</p>

<p>4. Persons at age who want not the right of a
stated relation, may have such actual natural and
moral indispositions, as may also make them for that
time unmeet to receive. As sickness, infection, a
journey, persecution, scattering the church, a prison.
And (morally) 1. Want of necessary knowledge of
the nature of the sacrament (which by the negligence
of pastors or parents may be the case of some
that are but newly past their childhood). 2. Some
heinous sin, of which the sinner hath not so far repented,
as to be yet ready to receive a sealed pardon,
or which is so scandalous in the church, as that
in public respects the person is yet unfit for its privileges.
3. Such sins or accusations of sin, as make
the person's church title justly controverted, and his
communion suspended, till the case be decided. 4.
Such fears of unworthy receiving, as were like to
hurt and distract the person, if he should receive till
he were better satisfied. These make a man uncapable
of present reception, and so are a bar to his plenary
right: they have still right to receive in a due
manner; but being yet uncapable of that due receiving,
they have not a plenary right to the thing.</p>

<p>5. The same may be said of other parts of our
duty and privileges. A man may have a relative,
habitual, or stated right to praise God, and give him
thanks for his justification, sanctification, and adoption,
and to godly conference, to exercises of humiliation,
&amp;c. who yet for want of present actual preparation,
may be uncapable, and so want a plenary
right.</p>

<p>6. The understanding of the double preparation
necessary, doth most clearly help us to understand
this case. A man that is in an unregenerate state,
must be visibly cured of that state, (of utter ignorance,
unbelief, ungodliness,) before he can be a
member of the church, and lay a claim to its privileges.
But when that is done, besides this general
preparation, a particular preparation also to each duty
is necessary to the right doing of it. A man must
understand what he goeth about, and must consider
of it, and come with some suitable affections. A
man may have right to go a journey, that wants a
horse; or may have a horse that is not saddled: he
that hath clothes must put them on, before he is fit
to come into company: he that hath right to write,
may want a pen, or have a bad one: having of gracious
habits, may need the addition of bringing
them into such acts as are suitable to the work in
hand.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXX. <i>Is there any such thing in the church, as a rank or
classis, or species of church members at age, who are not to be
admitted to the Lord's table, but only to hearing the word and prayer,
between infant members, and adult confirmed ones?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Some have excogitated such a classis, or
species, or order, for convenience, as a prudent, necessary
thing; because to admit all to the Lord's
table they think dangerous on one side; and to cast
all that are unfit for it out of the church, they think
dangerous on the other side, and that which the
people would not bear. Therefore to preserve the
reverence of the sacrament, and to preserve their own
and the church's peace, they have contrived this
middle way or rank. And indeed the controversy
seemeth to be more about the title (whether it may
be called a middle order of mere learners and worshippers)
than about the matter. I have occasionally
written more of it than I can here stay to recite;
and the accurate handling of it requireth more words
than I will here use. This breviate therefore shall
be all.</p>

<p>1. It is certain that such catechumens as are in
mere preparation to faith, repentance, and baptism,
are no church members or christians at all; and so
in none of these ranks.</p>

<p>2. Baptism is the only ordinary regular door of
entrance into the visible church; and no man (unless
in extraordinary cases) is to be taken for a
church member or visible christian till baptized.</p>

<p>Two objections are brought against this. 1. The
infants of christians are church members as such,
before baptism, and so are believers. They are
baptized because members, and not members by
baptism.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What makes a visible member?</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This case hath no difficulty.
1. A believer as such, is a member
of Christ and the church invisible,
but not of the visible church, till he be an orderly
professor of that belief. And this profession is not
left to every man's will how it shall be made, but
Christ hath prescribed and instituted a certain way
and manner of profession, which shall be the only
ordinary symbol or badge, by which the church
shall know visible members; and that is baptism.
Indeed when baptism cannot be had, an open profession
without it may serve; for sacraments are made
for man, and not man for sacraments. But when it
may be had, it is Christ's appointed symbol, <i>tessera</i>,
and church door. And till a person be baptized, he
is but irregularly and initially a professor; as an
embryo in the womb is a man; or as a covenant before
the writing, sealing, and delivering is initially a
covenant; or as persons privately contracted without
solemn matrimony are married; or as a man is a
minister upon election and trial before ordination:
he hath only, in all these cases, the beginning of a
title, which is not complete; nor at all sufficient <i>in
foro ecclesiæ</i>, to make a man visibly and legally a
married man, a minister, and so here a christian.
For Christ hath chosen his own visible badge, by
which his church members must be known.</p>

<p>2. And the same is to be said of the infant title of
the children of believers; they have but an initial
right before baptism, and not the badge of visible
christians. For there are three distinct gradations
to make up their visible Christianity. 1. Because
they are their own, (and as it were parts of themselves,)
therefore believers have power and obligation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">{678}</a></span>
to dedicate their children in covenant with God.
2. Because every believer is himself dedicated to
God, with all that is his own, (according to his capacity,)
therefore a believer's child is supposed to be
virtually (not actually) dedicated to God in his own
dedication or covenant, as soon as his child hath a
being. 3. Being thus virtually and implicitly first
dedicated, he is after actually and regularly dedicated
in baptism, and sacramentally receiveth the badge of
the church; and this maketh him a visible member
or christian, to which the two first were but introductory,
as conception is to human nativity.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the seed of believers as such are in the
covenant; and therefore church members.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The word covenant here is ambiguous;
either it signifieth God's law of grace, or prescribed
terms for salvation, with his immediate offer of the
benefits to accepters, called the single covenant of
God; or it signifieth this with man's consent, called
the mutual covenant, where both parties covenant.
In the former sense, the covenant only offereth
church membership, but maketh no man a church
member, till consent. It is but God's conditional
promise, "If thou believe thou shalt be saved," &amp;c.
If thou give up thyself and children to me, I will be
your God, and you shall be my people. But it is
only the mutual covenant that maketh a christian or
church member.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> The promise is to us and our children as
ours.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> That is, that you and your children dedicated
to God, shall be received into covenant; but
not otherwise. Believing is not only bare assenting,
but consenting to the covenant, and delivering up
yourselves to Christ; and if you do not consent that
your child shall be in the covenant, and deliver him
to God also, you cannot expect acceptance of him,
against your wills; nor indeed are you to be taken
for true believers yourselves, if you dedicate not
yourselves to him, and all that are in your power.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> This offer or conditional covenant belongeth
also to infidels.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The offer is to them, but they accept it not.
But every believer accepteth it for himself, and his,
or devoteth to God himself and his children when he
shall have them; and by that virtual dedication or
consent, his children are virtually in the mutual
covenant; and actually upon actual consent and
dedication.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But it is profession, and not baptism, that
makes a visible member.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> That is answered before: it is profession
by baptism; for baptism is that peculiar act of profession,
which God hath chosen to this use, when a
person is absolutely devoted, resigned, and engaged
to God in a solemn sacrament, this is our regular
initiating profession; and it is but an irregular
embryo of a profession, which goeth before baptism
ordinarily.</p>

<p><i>Prop. 3.</i> The time of infant membership, in which
we stand in covenant by our parents' consent, cannot
be determined by duration, but by the insufficiency
of reason, through immaturity of age, (or continuing
idiots,) to choose for oneself.</p>

<p><i>Prop. 4.</i> It is not necessary that the doctrine of the
Lord's supper be taught catechumens before baptism;
nor was it usual with the ancients so to do
(though it may very well be done.)</p>

<p><i>Prop. 5.</i> It is needful that the nature of the Lord's
supper be taught all the baptized before they receive
it, (as was opened before,) else they must do they
know not what.</p>

<p><i>Prop. 6.</i> Though the sacrament of the Lord's
supper seal not another, but the same covenant that
baptism sealeth; yet are there some further truths
therein expressed, and some more particular exercises
of faith in Christ's sacrifice, and coming, &amp;c.
and of hope, and love, and gratitude, &amp;c. requisite.
Therefore the same qualifications which will serve
for baptism, justification, and adoption, and salvation,
are not enough for the right use of church communion
in the Lord's supper, the one being the sacrament of
initiation and our new birth; the other of our confirmation,
exercise, and growth in grace.</p>

<p>7. Whether persons be baptized in infancy or at
age, if they do not before understand these higher
mysteries, they must stay from the exercise of them
till they understand them; and so with most there
must be a space of time between their baptism and
fuller communion.</p>

<p>8. But the same that we say of the Lord's supper
must be said of other parts of worship; singing
psalms, praise, thanksgivings, &amp;c. men must learn
them, before they can practise them; and usually
these as eucharistical acts concur with the Lord's
supper.</p>

<p>9. Whether you will call men in this state, church
members of a middle rank and order, between the
baptized and the communicants, is but a <i>lis de
nomine</i>, a verbal controversy. It is granted that such
a middle sort of men there are in the church.</p>

<p>10. It is to be maintained that these are in a state
of salvation, even before they thus communicate.
And that they are not kept away for want of a stated
relation title, but of an immediate capacity, as is
aforesaid.</p>

<p>11. There is no necessity, but upon such unfitness,
that there should be one day's time between baptism
and the sacrament of the Lord's supper: nor is it
desirable; for if the baptized understand those mysteries
the first day they may communicate in them.</p>

<p>12. Therefore as men are prepared, some may
suddenly communicate, and some stay longer.</p>

<p>13. When persons are at age, if pastors, parents,
and themselves be not grossly negligent, they may
and ought to learn these things in a very little time;
so that they need not be settled in a lower learning
state for any considerable time, unless their own
negligence be the cause.</p>

<p>14. And in order to their learning, they have
right to be spectators and auditors at the eucharist,
and not to be driven away with the catechumens, as
if they had no right to be there. For it is a thing
best taught by the practice to beholders.</p>

<p>15. But if any shall by scandal or gross neglect
of piety, and not only by ignorance, give cause of
questioning their title, and suspending their possession
of those sacred privileges, these are to be
reckoned in another rank, even among those whose
title to church membership itself becometh controverted,
and must undergo a trial in the church.</p>

<p>And this much I think may serve to resolve this
considerable question.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXI. <i>Whether a form of prayer be lawful?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I have said so much of this and some following
questions in many books already, that to avoid
repetition, I shall say very little here.</p>

<p>The question must be out of question with all
christians:</p>

<p>1. Because the Scripture itself hath many forms
of prayer; which therefore cannot be unlawful.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> They were lawful then, but not now.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> He that saith so, must prove where God
hath since forbidden them. Which can never be.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> They may lawfully be read in Scripture
for instruction, but not used as prayers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">{679}</a></span>
<i>Answ.</i> They were used as prayers then, and are
never since forbidden: yea, John and Christ did
teach their disciples to pray, and Christ thus prefaceth
his form, "When ye pray, say"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>2. All things must be done to edification: but to
use a form of prayer is for the edification of many
persons, at least those that cannot otherwise do so
well; therefore those persons must use a form.
Full experience doth prove the minor, and nothing
but strangeness to men can contradict it.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXII. <i>Are forms of prayer or preaching in the church
lawful?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes: most ministers study the methodical
form of their sermons before they preach them; and
many write the very words, or study them: and so
most sermons are a form. And sure it is as lawful
to think beforehand what to say in praying as in
preaching.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_320" id="Ref_320" href="#Foot_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That which God hath not forbidden is lawful;
but God hath not forbidden ministers to study their
sermons or prayers, either for matter, method, or
words, and so to make them many ways a form.</p>

<p>2. That which God prescribed is lawful (if he reverse
it not): but God prescribed public forms of
prayer; as the titles and matter of many of the
Psalms prove, which were daily used in the Jewish
synagogues.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Psalms being to be sung, are more than
prayers.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> They were prayers, though more. They
are called prayers, and for the matter many of them
were no more than prayers, but only for the measures
of words: nor was their singing like ours now, but
liker to our saying. And there are many other
prayers recorded in the Scripture.</p>

<p>3. And all the churches of Christ at least these
thirteen or fourteen hundred years have taken public
forms for lawful; which is not to be gainsayed without
proof.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_320" id="Foot_320" href="#Ref_320">[320]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
God gave forms of preaching to Moses and the prophets:
see a large form of prayer for all true people, Deut. xxvi. 13-15.
And so elsewhere there are many.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. LXXIII. <i>Are public forms of man's devising or composing
lawful?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes: 1. The ministers afore-mentioned
throughout the christian world, do devise and compose
the form of their own sermons and prayers:
and that maketh them not unlawful. 2. And whoever
speaketh <i>ex tempore</i>, his words are a form when
he speaketh them, though not a premeditated form.
3. And when Scripture so vehemently commandeth
us to search, meditate, study the Scriptures, and
take heed unto ourselves and unto doctrine, &amp;c.
what a person is that who will condemn prayer or
preaching, only because we beforehand studied or
considered what to say! as if God abhorred diligence
and the use of reason. Men are not tied
(now) from thinking beforehand what to say to the
judge at the bar for estate or life, or what to say on
an embassage, or to a king, or any man that we
converse with. And where are we forbidden to forethink
what to say to God? Must the people take
heed how they hear, and look to their foot when
they go into the house of God? and must not we
take heed what we speak, and look to our words that
they be fit and decent?</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Forms are images of prayer and preaching,
forbidden in the second commandment?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Prove it, and add not to the word of God.
1. The Scripture and God's servants, even Christ
himself, had broken the second commandment, when
they used or prescribed forms. 2. Forms are no
more images than extemporate words are, as they
signify our minds. Are all the catechisms, printed
and written sermons and prayers, images or idols?
all forms that parents teach their children? O charge
not such untruths on God; and invent not falsehoods
of his word, while you cry down man's inventions.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXIV. <i>Is it lawful to impose forms on the congregation or
the people in public worship?</i></h3>

<p>Yes, and more than lawful; it is the pastor's duty
so to do. For whether he forethink what to pray or
not, his prayer is to them a form of words; and they
are bound in all the lawful parts, to concur with him
in spirit or desire, and to say Amen. So that every
minister by office is daily to impose a form of prayer
on all the people in the congregation. Only some
men impose the same form many times over, or every
day, and others impose every day a new one.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXV. <i>Is it lawful to use forms composed by man, and imposed
not only on the people, but on the pastors of the churches?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The question concerneth not the lawfulness
of imposing, but of using forms imposed. And, 1. It
is not lawful to use them merely on that account because
they are imposed or commanded, without some
greater reason of the unlawfulness. For else it
would be unlawful for any other to use imposed
forms; as for a scholar or child, if the master or
parent impose them, or for the congregation when
the pastor imposeth them, which is not true.</p>

<p>2. The using of imposed forms may by other accidents
be sometimes good and sometimes evil, as the
accidents are that make it so.</p>

<p>1. These accidents may make it evil: (1.) When
the form is bad for matter or manner, and we voluntarily
prefer it before that which is better, being
willing of the imposition. (2.) When we do it to
gratify our slothfulness, or to cover our wilful ignorance
and disability. (3.) When we voluntarily obey
and strengthen any unlawful, usurping pastors or
powers that impose it without authority, and so encourage
church tyranny. (4.) When we choose a
singular form, imposed by some singular pastor, and
avoid that which the rest of the churches agree in,
at a time when it may tend to division and offence.
(5.) When the weakness and offence of the congregation
is such, that they will not join with us in the
imposed form, and so by using it, we drive them
from all public worship or divide them.</p>

<p>2. And in the following circumstances the using
of an imposed form is lawful and a duty: (1.) When
the minister is so weak that he cannot pray well
without one, nor compose so good a one himself.
(2.) Or when the errors or great weakness of the
generality of ministers is such, as that they usually
corrupt or spoil God's worship by their own manner
of praying, and no better are to be had; and thereupon
the wise and faithful pastors and magistrates
shall impose one sound and apt liturgy to avoid error
and division in such a distempered time; and the
ablest cannot be left at liberty without the relaxing
of the rest. (3.) When it is a means of the concord
of the churches, and no hinderance to our other prayers.
(4.) When our hearers will not join with us if
we use them not (for error and weakness must be
borne with on one side, as well as on the other).
(5.) When obedience to just authority requireth it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">{680}</a></span>
and no command of Christ is crossed by it. (6.)
When the imposition is so severe that we must so
worship God publicly, or not at all; and so all God's
public worship will be shut out of that congregation,
country, or nation, unless we will use imposed prayers.
(7.) In a word, when the good consequences of
obedience, union, avoiding offence, liberty for God's
public worship and preaching the gospel, &amp;c. are
greater than the bad consequences which are like to
follow the using of such forms: the preponderating
accidents must prevail. (8.) And if a man's own
judgment and conscience cannot be satisfied, to do
God's work comfortably and quietly any other way,
it may go far in the determination. And the common
good of many churches must still be preferred
before a less.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXVI. <i>Doth not the calling of a minister so consist in the
exercise of his own ministerial gifts, that he may not officiate
without them, nor make use of other men's gifts instead of them?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The office of the ministry is an obligation
and authority to do the ministerial work, by
those personal, competent abilities which God hath
given us.</p>

<p>2. This obligation to use our own abilities, forbiddeth
us not to make use of the helps, gifts, and abilities
of others; either to promote our own abilities
and habits, or to further us in the act or the exercise
of them. For, 1. There is no such prohibition in
Scripture. 2. All men are insufficient for themselves;
and nature and Scripture require them to use the
best help they can get from others. 3. God's service
must be done in the best manner we can. But
many ministers cannot do it so well (<i>consideratis considerandis</i>)
without other men's help as with it.</p>

<p>3. We may use other men's gifts to help us, 1. For
matter; 2. Method; 3. Words; and so for a threefold
form, of preaching or prayer.</p>

<p>4. He that useth a Scripture form of matter,
method, or words, useth his own abilities no more,
than if he used a form out of another book. But it
is lawful to use a Scripture form; therefore it is lawful
so far to take in assistance in the use of our own
abilities.</p>

<p>5. He that useth a form useth his own abilities
also (not only perhaps at other times, but) in the use
of it. He useth his understanding to discern the
true sense and aptitude of the words which he useth:
he useth his holy desires in putting up those prayers
to God; and his other graces, as he doth in other
prayers. He useth his utterance in the apt and decent
speaking of them.</p>

<p>6. A minister is not always bound to use his own
gifts to the utmost that he can, and other men's as
little as he can. For, 1. There is no such command
from God. 2. All things must be done to the church's
edification: but sometimes the greater use of another
man's gifts, and the less use of his own, may be to
the church's greater edification.</p>

<p>Instances of the lawful use of other men's gifts
are such as these.</p>

<p>1. For matter, an abler minister may tell a young
man what subjects are fittest for him in preaching
and prayer; and what is the sense of the Scriptures
which he is to open; and what is the true solution
of several doubts and cases. A minister that is
young, raw, or ignorant, (yea, the best,) may be a
learner while he is a teacher: but he that is a learner
maketh use so far of the gifts of others. And indeed
all teachers in the world make use of the gifts
of others; for all teach what they learn from others.</p>

<p>2. For method; it is lawful to learn that as well
as matter from another. Christ taught his disciples
a method of prayer; and other men may open that
method to us. All tutors teach their pupils method
as well as matter; for method is needful to the due
understanding and using of the matter. A method
of divinity, a method of preaching, and a method of
praying may be taught a preacher by word, and may
be written or printed for his use.</p>

<p>3. For words, 1. There is no more prohibition in
God's word, against learning or using another man's
words, than his method or matter. Therefore it is
not unlawful. 2. A tutor or senior minister may
teach the Scripture words to a pupil or junior minister;
yea, and may set them together and compose
him a sermon or prayer out of Scripture in its words.
(For he that may use an ill-composed Scripture form
of his own gathering, may use a well-composed form
of another's). 3. All the books in our libraries are
forms of words; and it is lawful sure to use some of
all those words which we read; or else our books
would be a snare and limitation to our language. 4.
All preachers ordinarily use citations, testimonies,
&amp;c. in other men's words. 5. All ministers use
psalms in the metre of other men's composing (and
usually imposing too). And there is no more prohibition
against using other men's words in a prayer,
than in a psalm. 6. Almost all ministers use other
men's gifts and form of words, in reading the Scriptures,
in their vulgar tongues: for God did not write
them by his apostles and prophets in English, French,
Dutch, &amp;c. but in Hebrew, Chaldee, and Greek;
therefore the wording them in English, &amp;c. is a human
form of words: and few ministers think they
are bound to translate all the Bible themselves, lest
they use other men's words or abilities. 7. If a
young minister that can pray but weakly, hear more
apt expressions and sentences in another minister's
prayers, than his own are, he may afterward make
use of those sentences and expressions. And if of
one sentence, why not of two or ten, when God hath
not forbidden it? So also in preaching. 8. It is
lawful to read another man's epistles or sermons in
the church, as the primitive churches did by Clement's
and some others. 9. An imposition may be so severe,
that we shall not use our own words, unless
we will use some of other men's. 10. All churches
almost in the world, have consented in the use of
creeds, confessions, and prayers, and psalms, in the
words of others.</p>

<p>But yet, 1. No minister must on these pretences
stifle his own gifts, and grow negligent; 2. Nor consent
to church tyranny or papal usurpations; 3. Nor
do that which tendeth to eat out seriousness in the
worship of God, and turn all into dead imagery or
formality.</p>

<h3>Quest. <i>Is it lawful to read a prayer in the church?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. That which is not forbidden is lawful:
but to read a prayer is not forbidden (as such, though
by accident it may).</p>

<p>2. The prayers in the Scripture psalms, were
usually read in the Jewish synagogues lawfully; for
they were written to that end, and were indeed the
Jewish liturgy. Therefore to read a prayer is not
unlawful.</p>

<p>3. He that hath a weak memory may read his own
sermon notes; therefore he may read his prayers.</p>

<p>4. I add as to this case and the former together;
that, 1. Christ did usually frequent the Jewish
synagogues.</p>

<p>2. That in those synagogues there were forms of
prayer, and that ordinarily read, at least Scripture
forms: and if either the Jewish rabbins (cited by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">{681}</a></span>
Scaliger, Selden in Eutych. Alexandr. &amp;c.,) or the
strongest probability may be credited, there were
also human forms. For who can imagine that those
Pharisees should have no human forms, (1.) Who
are so much accused of formality, and following traditions:
(2.) And used long and frequent prayers:
but if indeed they had no such forms, then long and
frequent extemporate prayers are not so great a sign
of the Spirit's gifts as is imagined, when such Pharisees
abounded in them. But there is little probability
but that they used both ways.</p>

<p>3. That Christ did not separate from the synagogues
for such prayers' sake.</p>

<p>4. Yea, that we never read that Christ meddled
in the controversy, it being then no controversy; nor
that he once reproved such forms, or reading them,
or ever called the Jews to repent of them.</p>

<p>If you say, his general reproof of traditions was
enough: I answer, 1. Even traditions he reproved
not as such, but as set before, or against the commands
of God. 2. He named many of their particular
traditions and corruptions, Matt. xv. xxiii. &amp;c.
and yet never named this. 3. His being usually
present at their assemblies, and so joining with them
in their worship, would be such an appearance of
his approbation, as would make it needful to express
his disallowance of it, if indeed he thought it sinful.
So that whoever impartially considereth all this, that
he joined with them, that he particularly reproved
other corruptions, and that he never said any thing
at all against forms or reading prayers, that is recorded,
will sure be moderate in his judgment of such
indifferent things, if he know what moderation is.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXVII. <i>Is it lawful to pray in the church without a
prescribed or premeditated form of words?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> There are so few sober and serious christians
that ever made a doubt of this, that I will not
bestow many words to prove it.</p>

<p>1. That which is not forbidden is lawful. But
church prayer without a premeditated or prescribed
form of words is not forbidden (by God); therefore
(as to God's laws) it is not unlawful.</p>

<p>2. To express holy desires understandingly, orderly,
seriously, and in apt expressions, is lawful praying.
But all this may be done without a set form of
words; therefore to pray without a set form of words
may be lawful.</p>

<p>3. The consent of the universal church, and the
experience of godly men, are arguments so strong,
as are not to be made light of.</p>

<p>4. To which Scripture instances may be added.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXVIII. <i>Whether are set forms of words, or free praying
without them, the better way? And what are the commodities and
incommodities of each way?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I will first answer the latter question, because
the former dependeth on it.</p>

<p>1. The commodities of a set form of words, and
the discommodities of free praying, are these following.</p>

<p>1. In a time of dangerous heresy which hath infected
the pastors, a set form of prescribed words
tendeth to keep the church, and the consciences of
the joiners, from such infection, offence, and guilt.</p>

<p>2. When ministers are so weak as to dishonour
God's worship by their unapt, and slovenly, and unsound
expressions, prescribed or set forms which
are well composed, are some preservative and cure.
When free praying leaveth the church under this
inconvenience.</p>

<p>3. When ministers by faction, passion, or corrupt
interests, are apt to put these vices into their prayers,
to the injury of others, and of the cause and church
of God, free praying cherisheth this, or giveth it opportunity,
which set forms do restrain.</p>

<p>4. Concordant set forms do serve for the exactest
concord in the churches, that all at once may speak
the same things.</p>

<p>5. They are needful to some weak ministers that
cannot do so well without them.</p>

<p>6. They somewhat prevent the laying of the reputation
of religious worship upon the minister's abilities:
when in free praying, the honour and comfort
varieth with the various degrees of pastoral abilities;
in one place it is excellently well done, in another
but dryly, and coldly, and meanly, in another erroneously,
unedifyingly, if not dishonourably, tending to
the contempt of holy things: whereas in the way of
set liturgies, though the ablest (at that time) doth no
better, yet the weakest doth (for words) as well, and
all alike.</p>

<p>7. And, if proud, weak men have not the composing
and imposing of it, all know that words drawn
up by study, upon sober premeditation and consultation,
have a greater advantage, to be exact and apt,
than those that were never thought on till we are
speaking them.</p>

<p>8. The very fear of doing amiss, disturbeth some unready
men, and maketh them do all the rest the worse.</p>

<p>9. The auditors know beforehand, whether that
which they are to join in be sound or unsound, having
time to try it.</p>

<p>10. And they can more readily put in their consent
to what is spoken, and make the prayer their
own, when they know beforehand what it is, than
they can do when they know not before they hear
it; it being hard to the duller sort of hearers, to
concur with an understanding and consent as quick
as the speaker's words are. Not but that this may
be done, but not without great difficulty in the duller
sort.</p>

<p>11. And it tendeth to avoid the pride and self-deceit
of many, who think they are good christians,
and have the spirit of grace and supplication, because
by learning and use they can speak many hours in
variety of expressions in prayer; which is a dangerous
mistake.</p>

<p>I. The commodities of free extemporate prayers,
and the discommodity of prescribed or set forms, are
these following.</p>

<p>1. It becometh an advantage to some proud men
who think themselves wiser than all the rest, to obtrude
their compositions, that none may be thought
wise enough, or fit to speak to God, but in their
words; and so introduce church tyranny.</p>

<p>2. It may become a hinderance to able, worthy
ministers that can do better.</p>

<p>3. It may become a dividing snare to the churches,
that cannot all agree and consent in such human
impositions.</p>

<p>4. It may become an advantage to heretics when
they can but get into power (as the Arians of old) to
corrupt all the churches and public worship; and thus
the papists have corrupted the churches by the mass.</p>

<p>5. It may become an engine or occasion of persecution,
and silencing all those ministers that cannot
consent to such impositions.</p>

<p>6. It may become a means of depraving the ministry,
and bringing them to a common idleness and
ignorance (if other things alike concur). For when
men perceive that no greater abilities are used and
required, they will commonly labour for and get no
greater, and so will be unable to pray without their
forms of words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">{682}</a></span>
7. And by this means christian religion may decay
and grow into contempt; for though it be desirable
that its own worth should keep up its reputation
and success, yet it never hitherto was so kept
up without the assistance of God's eminent gifts and
graces in his ministers; but wherever there hath
been a learned, able, holy, zealous, diligent ministry,
religion usually hath flourished; and wherever there
hath been an ignorant, vicious, cold, idle, negligent,
and reproached ministry, religion usually hath died
and been reproached. And we have now no reason
to look for that which never was, and that God
should take a new course in the world.</p>

<p>And the opinion of imposing forms of prayer, may
draw on the opinion of imposing forms of preaching
as much, and of restraining free preaching as much
as free praying, as we see in Muscovy. And then
when nothing but bare reading is required, nothing
more will be ordinarily sought; and so the ministry
will be the scorn of the people.</p>

<p>9. And it will be a shameful and uncomfortable
failing, when a minister is not able on variety of
occasions, to vary his prayers accordingly; and when
he cannot go any further than his book or lesson; it
being as impossible to make prayers just fitted to
all occasions which will fall out, as to make sermons
fit for all, or, as they say, to make a coat for the
moon; and the people will contemn the ministers
when they perceive this great deficiency.</p>

<p>10. And it is a great difficulty to many ministers
to learn and say a form without book; so that they
that can all day speak what they know, can scarce
recite a form of words one quarter of an hour, the
memory more depending upon the body and its temper,
than the exercise of the understanding doth.
He that is tied just to these words and no other, is
put upon double difficulties (like him that on height
must walk on a narrow plank, where the fear of falling
will make him fall); but he that may express
the just desires of his soul in what words occur that
are apt and decent, is like one that hath a field to
walk in: for my own part, it is easier to me to pray
or preach six hours in freedom, about things which
I understand, than to pray or preach the tenth part
of an hour in the fetters of a form of words which I
must not vary. And so the necessity of a book coming
in, doth bring down the reputation of the minister's
abilities in the people's eyes.</p>

<p>11. But the grand incommodity, greater than all
the rest, is, that it usually occasioneth carelessness,
deadness, formality, and heartless lip-labour in our
prayers to God; whilst the free way of present
prayer tendeth to excite our cogitations to consider
what we say. And it is not only the multitude of
dead-hearted hypocrites in the church that are thus
tempted to persevere in their lip-labour and hypocrisy,
and to draw near to God with their lips when their
hearts are far from him, and are gratified in their
self-deceit, whilst parrot-like they speak the words
which they regard not, and their tongues do overgo
their hearts; but even better men are greatly
tempted to dead remissness: I mean both the
speakers and the hearers; for, (1.) It is natural to
man's mind to have a slothful weariness as well as
his body; and to do no more than he findeth a necessity
of doing; and though God's presence alone
should suffice to engage all the powers of our souls,
yet sad experience telleth us, that God's eye and
man's together will do more with almost all men,
than one alone. And therefore no men's thoughts
are so accurately governed as their words. Therefore
when a minister knoweth beforehand that, as to
man's approbation, he hath no more to do but to
read that which he seeth before him, he is apt to let
his thoughts fly abroad, and his affections lie down,
because no man taketh account of these; but in extemporate
diversified prayer, a man cannot do it
without an excitation of his understanding to think
(to the utmost) what to say; and an excitation of
his affections, to speak with life, or else the hearers
will perceive his coldness. And though all this may
be counterfeit and hypocritically affected, yet it is a
great help to seriousness and sincerity to have the
faculties all awake; and it is a great help to awaken
them to be under such a constant necessity even
from man. As those that are apt to sleep at prayer,
will do it less when they know men observe them,
than at another time.</p>

<p>(2.) And both to speaker and hearers, human
frailty maketh it hard to be equally affected with the
same thing spoken a hundred times, as we are at
first when it is new, and when it is clothed in comely
variety of expressions. As the same book affecteth
us not at the twentieth reading as it did at the first.
Say not, it is a dishonourable weakness to be thus
carried by the novelty of things or words; for
though that be true, it is a dishonour common to all
mankind, and a disease which is your own, and
which God alloweth us all lawful means to cure, and
to correct the unhappy effects while it is uncured.</p>

<p>12. Lastly, set forms serve unworthy men to hide
their unworthiness by, and to be the matter of a controversy
in which they may vent their envy against
them that are abler and holier than themselves.</p>

<p>III. Having now truly showed you the commodities
and incommodities of both the ways, for the
other question, Which of them is the best? I must
give you but some rules to answer it yourselves.</p>

<p>1. That is best which hath most and greatest commodities,
and fewest and least discommodities.</p>

<p>2. For neither of them is forbidden, in itself considered,
nor evil, but by accident.</p>

<p>3. One may have more commodities and the other
more discommodities in one country and age than in
another, and with some persons than with others.</p>

<p>4. Sober christians should be very backward in
such cases to quarrel with the churches where they
live or come, but humbly submit to them in lawful
things, though they think them inconvenient; because
it is not they that are the governors and judges.</p>

<p>5. The commands of authority and the concord of
the churches may weigh down many lighter accidents.</p>

<p>6. I crave leave to profess that my own judgment
is, that somewhat of both ways joined together will
best obviate the incommodities of both. To have so
much wholesome, methodical, unquestionable forms
as near as may be in Scripture phrase, as is necessary
to avoid the inconvenience of a total exclusion
of forms, and to the attainment of their desirable
ends; and to have so much withal of freedom in
prayer, as is necessary to its ends, and to avoid the
deadness, formality, and other incommodities of
forms alone. Though by this opinion I cross the
conceits of prejudiced men on both extremes, I think
I cross not the judgment of the church of England,
which alloweth free prayers in the pulpit, and at the
visitation of the sick; and I cross not the opinion of
any ancient church that ever I read of, nor of the
fathers and pastors whose works are come to our
hands; nor yet of Luther, Melancthon, Bucer, Zuinglius,
Calvin, Beza, Zanchius, and the rest of our
famous reformers; nor yet of the famous nonconformists
of England, Cartwright, Hildersham, Greenham,
Perkins, Bain, Amesius, &amp;c. and I less fear
erring in all this company, than with those on either
of the extremes.<span

I have a manuscript of Mr. Cartwright's in which, having
fully proved the falsehood of Sutliff's suspicion that he was
acquainted with Hacket's project, he answereth his charge,
as if he were against forms of prayer, that all the years that
he lived at Middleburg and Antwerp, he constantly used the
same form before sermon, and mostly after sermon, and also
did read prayers in the church; and that since he seldom
concluded but with the Lord's prayer.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXIX. <i>Is it lawful to forbear the preaching of some truths,
upon man's prohibition, that I may have liberty to preach the rest;
yea, and to promise beforehand to forbear them? Or to do it for the
church's peace?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Some truths are of so great moment and
necessity, that without them you cannot preach the
gospel in a saving sort. These you may not forbear,
nor promise to forbear.</p>

<p>2. Some truths are such as God at that time doth
call men eminently to publish and receive (as against
some heresy when it is at the very height, or the
church in greatest danger of it); or concerning some
duty which God then specially calleth men to perform
(as the duty of loyalty just in the time of a
perilous rebellion, &amp;c.) Such preaching being a
duty, must not be forborne, when it cannot be performed
upon lawful terms.</p>

<p>3. But some truths are controverted among good
men; and some are of a lower nature and usefulness:
and concerning these I further say,</p>

<p>(1.) That you may not renounce them or deny
them, nor subscribe to the smallest untruth for liberty
to preach the greatest truth.</p>

<p>(2.) But you may for the time that the church's
benefit requireth it, both forbear to preach them,
and promise to forbear, both for the church's peace,
and for that liberty to preach the gospel, which you
cannot otherwise obtain. The reasons are,</p>

<p>1. Because it is not a duty to preach them at that
time; for no duty is a duty at all times: affirmative
precepts bind not <i>ad semper</i>, because man cannot
always do them.</p>

<p>2. It is a sin to prefer a lesser truth or good before
a greater. You cannot speak all things at once.
When you have all done, some, yea, a thousand must
be by you omitted. Therefore the less should be
omitted rather than the greater.</p>

<p>3. You have your office to the church's edification.
Preaching is made for man, and not man for
preaching. But the church's edification requireth
you rather to preach the gospel, than that opinion
or point which you are required to forbear. Without
this the hearers may be saved, but not without
the gospel.</p>

<p>And what a man may do and must do, he may on
good occasion promise to do.</p>

<p>He that thinketh diocesans, or liturgies, or ceremonies
unlawful, and yet cannot have leave to preach
the gospel (in time of need) unless he will forbear,
and promise to forbear to preach against them, may
and ought so to do and promise, rather than not to
preach the gospel.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But if men imprison or hinder me from
preaching, that is their fault; but if I voluntarily
forbear any duty, it is my own fault.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is to forbear a sin, and not a duty at
that time; it is no more a duty than reading, or singing,
or praying at sermon time. 2. When you are
in prison, or know in all probability you shall be
there, though by other men's fault, it is your own
fault if you will deny a lawful means to avoid it:
for your not preaching the gospel is then your own
sin, as well as other men's; and theirs excuseth not
yours.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXX. <i>May or must a minister silenced, or forbid to preach
the gospel, go on still to preach it, against the law?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Distinguish between, 1. Just silencing, and
unjust. 2. Necessary preaching, and unnecessary.</p>

<p>1. Some men are justly forbidden to preach the
gospel: as, 1. Those that are utterly unable, and do
worse than nothing when they do it. 2. Those that
are heretics and subvert the essentials of christianity
or godliness. 3. Those that are so impious and
malignant, that they turn all against the practice of
that religion which they profess; in a word, all that
do (directly) more hurt than good.</p>

<p>2. In some places there are so many able preachers,
that some tolerable men may be spared, if not
accounted supernumeraries; and the church will not
suffer by their silence. But in other countries either
the preachers are so few, or so bad, or the people so
very ignorant, and hardened, and ungodly, or so
great a number that are in deep necessity, that the
need of preaching is undeniable. And so I conclude,</p>

<p>1. That he that is justly silenced, and is unfit to
preach, is bound to forbear.</p>

<p>2. He that is silenced by just power, though unjustly,
in a country that needeth not his preaching,
must forbear there, and if he can must go into
another country where he may be more serviceable.</p>

<p>3. Magistrates may not ecclesiastically ordain
ministers or degrade them, but only either give them
liberty, or deny it them as there is cause.</p>

<p>4. Magistrates are not the fountain of the ministerial
office, as the sovereign is of all the civil power
of inferior magistrates; but both offices are immediately
from God.</p>

<p>5. Magistrates have not power from God to forbid
men to preach in all cases, nor as they please, but
justly only and according to God's laws.</p>

<p>6. Men be not made ministers of Christ only <i>pro
tempore</i> or on trial, to go off again if they dislike it;
but are absolutely dedicated to God, and take their
lot for better and for worse; which maketh the
Romanists say, that ordination is a sacrament (and
so it may be aptly called); and that we receive an
indelible character, that is, an obligation during
life, unless God himself disable us.</p>

<p>7. As we are nearlier devoted and related to God,
than church lands, goods, and temples are, so the
sacrilege of alienating a consecrated person unjustly,
is greater and more unquestionable than the sacrilege
of alienating consecrated houses, lands, or
things. And therefore no minister may sacrilegiously
alienate himself from God and his undertaken office
and work.</p>

<p>8. We must do any lawful thing to procure the
magistrate's licence to preach in his dominions.</p>

<p>9. All men silenced or forbidden by magistrates to
preach, are not thereby obliged or warranted to forbear.
For, 1. The apostles expressly determine it,
Acts iv. 19, "Whether it be better to hearken to
God rather than to you, judge ye." 2. Christ oft
foretold his servants, that they must preach against
the will of rulers, and suffer by them. 3. The
apostles and ordinary ministers also for 300 years
after Christ did generally preach against the magistrate's
will, throughout the Roman empire and the
world. 4. The orthodox bishops commonly took
themselves bound to preach when Arian or other
heretical emperors forbad them. 5. A moral duty
of stated necessity to the church and men's salvation
is not subjected to the will of men for order's sake:
for order is for the thing ordered and for the end.
Magistrates cannot dispense with us, for not loving
our neighbours, or not showing mercy to the poor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">{684}</a></span>
or saving the lives of the needy in famine and distress.
Else they that at last shall hear, "I was
hungry and ye fed me not, I was naked and ye
clothed me not, I was in prison and ye visited me
not," might oft say, Our parents, masters, or magistrates
forbad us. Yet a lesser moral duty may be
forbidden by the magistrate for the sake of a greater,
because then it is no duty indeed, and may be forborne
if he forbid it not; as to save one man's life, if
it would prove the death of a multitude; or to save
one man's house on fire, if so doing would fire
many. Therefore,</p>

<p>10. It is lawful and a duty to forbear some certain
time or number of sermons, prayers, or sacraments,
&amp;c. when either the present use of them would apparently
procure more hurt than good, or when the
forbearance were like to procure more good than the
doing of them; for they are all for our edification,
and are made for man, and not man for them (though
for God). As if forbearing this day would procure
me liberty for many days' service afterward, &amp;c.</p>

<p>11. It is not lawful at the command of man to forsake
or forbear our calling and duty, when it is to be
judged necessary to the honour of God, to the good
of the church, and of men's souls; that is, when as
in Daniel's case, Dan. vi. our religion itself and our
owning the true God, doth seem suspended by the
suspense of our duty; or when the multitude of
ignorant, hardened, ungodly souls, and the want of
fit men for number and quality, doth put it past controversy,
that our work is greatly necessary.</p>

<p>12. Those that are not immediately called by
Christ as were the apostles, but by men, being yet
statedly obliged to the death when they are called,
may truly say as Paul, "Necessity is laid upon me,
and woe be to me if I preach not the gospel."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_322" id="Ref_322" href="#Foot_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Papists and protestants concur in this judgment.
Papists will preach when the law forbids
them; and the judgment of protestants is, among
others, by Bishop Bilson of Subjection, and Bishop
Andrews, Tortur. Tort. plainly so asserted.</p>

<p>14. But all that are bound to preach, are not
bound to do it to the same number, nor in the same
manner; as they have not the same opportunity and
call. Whether it shall be, in this place or that, to
more or fewer, at this hour or that, are not determined
in Scripture, nor alike to all.</p>

<p>15. The temples, tithes, and such adjuncts of worship
and ministry, are at the magistrate's disposal,
and must not be invaded against his laws.</p>

<p>16. Where any are obliged to preach in a forbidden,
discountenanced state, they must study to do it
with such prudence, caution, peaceableness, and
obedience in all the lawful circumstantials, as may
tend to maintain peace and the honour of magistracy,
and to avoid temptations to sedition, and unruly
passions.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXXI. <i>May we lawfully keep the Lord's day as a fast?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Not ordinarily; because God hath made it
a day of thanksgiving; and we must not pervert it
from the use to which it was appointed by God.
But in case of extraordinary necessity, it may be
done: as, 1. In case that some great judgment call
us so suddenly to humiliation and fasting, as that it
cannot be deferred to the next day (as some sudden
invasion, fire, sickness, &amp;c.) 2. In case by persecution
the church be denied liberty to meet on any
other day, in a time when public fasting and prayer
is a duty. 3. In case the people be so poor, or
servants, children, and wives be so hardly restrained,
that they cannot meet at any other time. It is lawful
in such cases, because positives give way to
moral or natural duties, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, and lesser
duties unto greater: the sabbath is made for man,
and not man for the sabbath.<span

<p>2. And therefore the celebration of the sacrament
of the Lord's supper was always a chief part of its
observation in the primitive churches: not merely
for the sacrament's sake; but because with it was
still joined all the laudatory and thanksgiving worship.
And it was the pastor's work so to pray, and
praise God, and preach to the people, as tendeth
most to possess their souls with the liveliest sense of
the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the
communion of the Holy Spirit, on the account of our
redemption.</p>

<p>3. Though confession of sin and humiliation must
not be the chief work of the day, yet it may and
must come in, as in due subordination to the chief.
1. Because there are usually many persons present,
who are members only of the visible church, and are
not fit for the laudatory and rejoicing part. 2. Because
while we are in the flesh, our salvation is imperfect,
and so are we; and much sin still remaineth,
which must be a grief and burden to believers: and
therefore while sin is mixed with grace, repentance
and sorrow must be mixed with our thanksgivings,
and we must "rejoice with trembling." And though
we "receive a kingdom which cannot be moved,"
yet must our "acceptable service of God be with reverence
and godly fear, because our God is a consuming
fire."<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_325" id="Ref_325" href="#Foot_325">[325]</a></span>
3. Our sin and misery being that
which we are saved from, doth enter the definition
of our salvation. And without the sense of them, we
can never know aright what mercy is, nor ever be
truly glad and thankful. But yet take heed that this
subordinate duty be not pretended, for the neglecting
of that thanksgiving which is the work of the day.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXXIII. <i>May the people bear a vocal part in worship, or do
any more than say, Amen?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_326" id="Ref_326" href="#Foot_326">[326]</a></span>
the people should say Amen; that
is, openly signify their consent. But the meaning is
not that they must do no more, nor otherwise express
their consent saving by that single word. For,
1. There is no scripture which forbiddeth more.
2. The people bear an equal part in singing the
psalms; which are prayer, and praise, and instruction.
3. If they may do so in the psalms in metre,
there can no reason be given but they may lawfully
do so in the psalms in prose; for saying them and
singing them are but modes of utterance; both are
the speaking of prayer and praise to God: and
the ancient singing was liker our saying, than to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">{685}</a></span>
our tunes, as most judge. 4. The primitive christians
were so full of the zeal and love of Christ, that
they would have taken it for an injury and a quenching
of the Spirit, to have been wholly restrained from
bearing their part in the praises of the church.
5. The use of the tongue keepeth awake the mind,
and stirreth up God's graces in his servants. 6. It
was the decay of zeal in the people that first shut
out responses; while they kept up the ancient zeal,
they were inclined to take their part vocally in their
worship; and this was seconded by the pride and
usurpation of some priests thereupon, who thought
the people of God too profane to speak in the assemblies,
and meddle so much with holy things.</p>

<p>Yet the very remembrance of former zeal, caused
most churches to retain many of the words of their
predecessors, even when they lost the life and spirit
which should animate them. And so the same words
came into the liturgies, and were used by too many
customarily, and in formality, which their ancestors
had used in the fervour of their souls.</p>

<p>6. And if it were not that a dead-hearted, formal
people, by speaking the responses carelessly and
hypocritically, do bring them into disgrace with many
that see the necessity of seriousness, I think few
good people would be against them now. If all the
serious, zealous christians in the assembly speak the
same words in a serious manner, there will appear
nothing in them that should give offence. If in the
fulness of their hearts, the people should break out
into such words of prayer, or confession, or praise, it
would be taken for an extraordinary pang of zeal;
and were it unusual, it would take exceedingly. But
the better any thing is, the more loathsome it appeareth
when it is mortified by hypocrisy and dead
formality, and turned into a mockery, or an affected,
scenical act. But it is here the duty of every christian
to labour to restore the life and spirit to the
words, that they may again be used in a serious and
holy manner as heretofore.</p>

<p>7. Those that would have private men pray and
prophesy in public, as warranted by 1&nbsp;Cor. xiv. "Ye
may all speak," &amp;c. do much contradict themselves,
if they say also that a layman may say nothing but
Amen.</p>

<p>8. The people were all to say Amen in Deut. xxvii.
15, 16, 18-20, &amp;c. And yet they oftentimes said
more. As Exod. xix. 8, in as solemn an assembly as
any of ours, when God himself gave Moses a sermon
(in a form of words) to preach to the people, and
Moses had repeated it as from the Lord, (it being
the narrative of his mercies, the command of obedience,
and the promises of his great blessings upon
that condition,) "all the people answered together
and said, All that the Lord hath spoken we will do."
The like was done again, Exod. xxiv. 3, and Deut.
v. 27. And lest you should think either that the assembly
was not as solemn as ours, or that it was not
well done of the people to say more than Amen, God
himself who was present declared his approbation,
even of the words, when the speakers' hearts were
not so sincere in speaking them as they ought: ver.
28, 29, "And the Lord heard the voice of your
words when you spake unto me, and the Lord said
unto me, I have heard the voice of the words of this
people&mdash;They have well said all that they have
spoken. O that there were such a heart in them&mdash;."</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But this is but a speech to Moses, and not
to God.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I will recite to you a form of prayer which
the people themselves were to make publicly to God:
Deut. xxvi. 13-15, "Then shalt thou say before
the Lord thy God, I have brought away the hallowed
things out of my house, and also have given them
unto the Levite and unto the stranger, to the fatherless,
and to the widow, according to all thy commandments
which thou hast commanded me: I have not
transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten
them. I have not eaten thereof in my mourning,
neither have I taken away ought thereof for any
unclean use, nor given ought thereof for the dead;
but I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord my
God, and have done according to all that thou hast
commanded me. Look down from thy holy habitation,
from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and
the land which thou hast given us, as thou swarest
unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
honey." Is not here a full form of prayer to be used
by all the people? And remember that Joseph and
Mary, and Christ himself, were under this law, and
that you never read that Christ found fault with the
people's speech, nor spake a word to restrain it in
his churches.</p>

<p>In Lev. ix. 24, "When all the people saw the
glory of the Lord, and the fire that came out from it,
and consumed the burnt offering, they shouted and
fell on their faces;" which was an acclamation more
than bare amen.</p>

<p>2&nbsp;Kings xxiii. 2, 3, "King Josiah went up into
the house of the Lord, and all the men of Judah,
&amp;c. and the priests and the prophets, and all the
people, both small and great: and he read in their
ears all the words of the book of the covenant. And
the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before
the Lord, to walk after the Lord, and to keep
his commandments, &amp;c. with all their heart, and all
their soul, &amp;c. And all the people stood to the covenant."
Where, as a king is the speaker, it is like that
the people used some words to express their consent.</p>

<p>1&nbsp;Chron. xvi. 35, 36, when David delivered a
psalm for a form of praise: in which it is said to
the people, ver. 35, "And say ye, Save us, O God of
our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us
from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy
holy name, and glory in thy praise. Blessed be
the Lord God of Israel for ever and ever. All the
people said, Amen, and praised the Lord." Where
it is like that their praising the Lord was more than
their amen.</p>

<p>And it is a command, Psal. lxvii. 3, 5, "Let all
the people praise thee, O God, let all the people
praise thee." And he that will limit this to single
persons, or say that it must not be vocally in the
church, or it must be only in metre and never in
prose, or only in tunes and not without, must prove
it, lest he be proved an adder to God's word.</p>

<p>But it would be tedious to recite all the repeated
sentences in the Psalms, which are commonly supposed
to be the responses of the people, or repeated by
them. And in Rev. xiv. 2, 3, the voice as "of many
waters and as of a great thunder, and the voice of
harpers harping with their harps, who sung a new
song before the throne and before the four beasts
and the elders, a song which none could learn but
the hundred forty and four thousand which were redeemed
from the earth, which were not defiled with
women, who were virgins and followed the Lamb,"
&amp;c. doth seem very plainly to be spoken of the
praises of all the saints. Chap. xvii. 15, by waters
is meant people, multitudes, &amp;c. And chap. xix. 5-8,
there is expressly recited a form of praise for
all the people: "A voice came out of the throne, saying,
Praise our God, all ye his servants, and ye that
fear him, both small and great. And I heard as it
were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice
of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings,
saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent
reigneth. Let us be glad, and rejoice, and give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">{686}</a></span>
honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is
come, and his wife hath made herself ready. And
to her it was granted," &amp;c.</p>

<p>And indeed he that hath styled all his people "priests
to God, and a holy and royal priesthood, to offer up
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ,
and to show forth the praises (<span title="tas aretas">τὰς ἀρετὰς</span>, the virtues)
of him that hath called us out of darkness into his
marvellous light," doth seem not to take them for so
profane a generation, as to be prohibited from speaking
to God in public any otherwise than by the
mouth of a priest.</p>

<p>And it seemeth to be more allowed (and not less)
under the gospel, than under the law; because then
the people, as under guilt, were kept at a greater distance
from God, and must speak to him more by a
priest that was a type of Christ our Intercessor.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_327" id="Ref_327" href="#Foot_327">[327]</a></span>
But now we are brought nigh, and reconciled to God,
and have the spirit of sons, and may go by Christ
alone unto the Father. And therefore though it be
true that ministers yet are sub-intercessors under
Christ our High Priest, yet they are rarely called
priests, but described more in the New Testament
by other parts of their office.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the people's responses make a confused
noise in the assemblies, not intelligible.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> All things are ill done, that are done by ill
men that carnally and formally slubber it over: but
if the best and holiest people would unanimously set
themselves to do it, as they do in singing psalms, so
that they did not only stand by to be the hearers of
others, it would be done more orderly and spiritually,
as well as singing is.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXXIV. <i>Is it not a sin for our clerks to make themselves
the mouth of the people, who are no ordained ministers of Christ?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. In those places where ordained deacons do
it, this objection hath no place. 2. The clerks are
not appointed to be the mouth of the people, but
only each clerk is one of the people commanded to
do that which all should do, lest it should be wholly
left undone. If all the congregation will speak all
that the clerk doth, it will answer the primary desire
of the church governors, who bid the people do it;
but if they that will not do it themselves, shall pretend
that the clerk doth usurp the ministry, because
he ceaseth not as well as they; they might as well
say so by a few that should sing psalms in the
church, when the rest are against it and forbear.
May not a man do his duty in singing or saying,
when you refuse yours, without pretending to be
your mouth, or usurping the ministry?</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXXV. <i>Are repetitions of the same words in church prayers,
lawful?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is not lawful to affect them as the heathens,
who think they shall be heard for their battology,
or saying over the same words, as if God
were moved by them, as by a charm.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_328" id="Ref_328" href="#Foot_328">[328]</a></span>
2. Nor is it
lawful to do that which hath a strong appearance of
such a conceit, and thereby to make God's worship
ridiculous and contemptible; as the papists in their
psalters, and prayer books, repeating over the name
of Jesus, and Mary, so oft together as maketh it seem
a ludicrous canting.</p>

<p>But, 1. It is lawful to speak the same words from
fulness and fervency of zeal; 2. And when we are
afraid to give over lest we have not yet prevailed
with God. 3. And in God's solemn praises (sung or
said) a word or sentence oft repeated sometimes
hath an elegancy, and affecting decency; and therefore
it is so often used in the Psalms; yea, and in
many Scripture prayers. 4. In such cases, to bring
a serious urgency of spirit to the repeated words,
and not to quarrel with the repetitions, is the duty
of one that joineth with true christian assemblies,
as a son of piety and peace.<span

<h3>Quest. LXXXVI. <i>Is it lawful to bow at the naming of Jesus?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The question either respecteth the person
of Jesus, named by any of his names, or else this
name Jesus only. And that either simply in itself
considered; or else comparatively, as excluding, or
not including, other names.</p>

<p>1. That the person of Jesus is to be bowed to, I
never knew a christian deny.</p>

<p>2. That we may lawfully express our reverence by
bowing, when the names, God, Jehovah, Jesus Christ,
&amp;c. are uttered, I have met with few christians
who deny, nor know I any reason to deny it.</p>

<p>3. Had I been fit to have prescribed directions to
other ministers or churches, I would not have persuaded,
much less commanded, them to bow at the
name of Jesus, any more than at the name of God,
Jehovah, Christ, &amp;c. for many reasons which the
reader may imagine, though I will not now mention
them.</p>

<p>4. But if I live and join in a church where it is
commanded and peremptorily urged to bow at the
name of Jesus, and where my not doing it would be
divisive, scandalous, or offensive, I will bow at the
name of God, Jehovah, Jesus, Christ, Lord, &amp;c. one
as well as the other; seeing it is not bowing at
Christ's name that I scruple, but the consequents of
seeming to distinguish and prefer that name alone before
all the rest.<span

<h3>Quest. LXXXVII. <i>Is it lawful to stand up at the gospel as we are
appointed?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Had I been a prescriber to others myself,
I should not have required the church to stand
up at the reading of one part of a chapter by the
name of the gospel, and not at the same words when
the whole chapter is read.</p>

<p>2. But if I live where rulers peremptorily command
it, (I suppose not forbidding us to stand up at
the gospel read in chapters, but selecting this as an
instance of their signified consent to the gospel, who
will do no more,) I would obey them rather than give
offence, by standing up at the reading of the chapters
and all; which I suppose will be no violation
of their laws.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXXVIII. <i>Is it lawful to kneel when the decalogue is
read?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. If I lived in a church that mistook the
commandments for prayers, as many ignorant people
do, I would not so harden them in that error. 2. And
if I knew that many of the people present are of that
mind, I had rather do nothing that might scandalize
or harden them in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">{687}</a></span>
But, 1. That the thing in itself is lawful, is past
doubt: as we may kneel to the king when we hear
him or speak to him; so it is lawful to kneel to God,
when we read a chapter or hear it read, and specially
the decalogue so terribly delivered, and written
by his own finger in stone. 2. And if it be
peremptorily commanded, and the omission would
be offensive, I would use it though mistaking persons
are present, (1.) Because I cannot disobey,
and also differ from the whole assembly, without a
greater hurt and scandal, than seeming to harden
that mistaking person. (2.) And because I could
and would by other means remove that person's
danger, as from me, by making him know that it is
no prayer. (3.) And the rather in our times, because
we can get the minister in the pulpit publicly
to tell the people the contrary. (4.) And in catechising
it is his appointed duty so to do. (5.) And
we find that the same old silly people who took the
commandments for a prayer, took the creed to be so
too; when yet none kneeled at the creed; by which it
appeareth that it is not kneeling which deceived them.</p>

<h3>Quest. LXXXIX. <i>What gestures are fittest in all the public
worship?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The customs of several countries, putting
several significations on gestures, much varieth
the case.</p>

<p>2. We must not lightly differ from the customs of
the churches where we live in such a thing.</p>

<p>3. According to the present state of our churches,
and the signification of gestures, and the necessities
of men's bodies, all considered, I like best, (1.) To
kneel in prayer and confession of sin (unless it be in
crowded congregations where there is not room).
(2.) To stand up in actions of mere praise to God,
that is, at the singing and reading of the psalms of
praise, and at the other hymns. (3.) To sit at the
hearing of the word read and preached (because the
body hath a necessity of some rest).</p>

<p>4. Had I my choice, I would receive the Lord's
supper sitting; but where I have not, I will use the
gesture which the church useth. And it is to be
noted that the church of England requireth the
communicant only to receive it kneeling; but not to
eat or drink it kneeling when they have received it.
The ancient churches took it for a universal custom,
established by many general councils, (and
continued many hundred years,) that no churches
should kneel in any act of adoration upon any Lord's
day in the year, or any week day between Easter
and Whitsuntide; but only stand all the time. But
because the weariness of the body is apt to draw the
mind into consent, and make God's service burdensome
to us, it seemeth a sufficient compliance with
their custom and the reasons of it, if we stand up
only in acts of praise (and at the profession of our
assent to the christian faith and covenant).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_331" id="Ref_331" href="#Foot_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>5. And because there is so great a difference between
the auditors in most assemblies, some being
weak and not able to stand long, &amp;c. therefore it is
utterly unmeet to be too rigorous in urging a uniformity
of gesture, or for any to be too censorious of
other men for a gesture.</p>

<h3>Quest. XC. <i>What if the pastor and church cannot agree about singing
psalms, or what version or translation to use, or time or place of
meeting, &amp;c.?</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">I meddle not here with the magistrate's part.</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is the office of the
pastor to be the guide and ruler in
such things, (when the magistrate
interposeth not,) and the people should obey him.
2. But if the pastor injure the church by his misguidance
and mal-administration, he ought to amend
and give them satisfaction; and if he do not, they
have their remedy before mentioned. 3. And if the
people be obstinate in disobedience upon causeless
quarrels, the pastor must first labour to convince
them by reason and love, and his authority; and if
no means will bring them to submission, he must
consider whether it be better as to the public good
of the church of Christ that he comply with them,
and suffer them, or that he depart and go to a more
tractable people; and accordingly he is to do. For
they cannot continue together in communion if one
yield not to the other: usually or ofttimes it will be
better to leave such an obdurate, self-willed people,
lest they be hardened by yielding to them in their
sin, and others encouraged in the like by their example;
and their own experience may at last convince
them, and make them yield to better things,
as Geneva did when they revoked Calvin. But
sometimes the public good requireth that the pastor
give place to the people's folly, and stay among
them, and rather yield to that which is not best,
(so it be otherwise lawful,) as a worse translation,
a worse version, liturgy, order, time, place, &amp;c.
than quite forsake them. And he that is in the right,
may in that case yield to him that is in the wrong,
in point of practice.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCI. <i>What if the pastor excommunicate a man, and the people
will not forbear his communion, as thinking him unjustly
excommunicated?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Either the pastor or the people are in
the error. 2. Either the person is a dangerous heretic,
or grossly wicked, or not. 3. Either the people
do own the error or sin, for which he is excommunicated,
or only judge the person not guilty. 4. The
pastor's and the people's part in the execution must
be distinguished. And so I conclude,</p>

<p>1. That if the pastor err and wrong the people, he
must repent and give them satisfaction; but if it be
their error and obstinacy, then, 2. If the pastor foreknow
that the people will dissent, in some small dispensable
cases he may forbear to excommunicate one
that deserveth it; or if he know it after, that they
will not forbear communion with the person, he may
go on in his office, and be satisfied that he hath discharged
his own duty, and leave them under the
guilt of their own faults. 3. But if it be an intolerable
wickedness or heresy, (as Arianism, Socinianism,
&amp;c.) and the people own the error or sin as well as
the person, the pastor is then to admonish them
also, and by all means to endeavour to bring them
to repentance; and if they remain impenitent to renounce
communion with them and desert them.
4. But if they own not the crime, but only think the
person injured, the pastor must give them the proof
for their satisfaction; and if they remain unsatisfied,
he may proceed in his office as before.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCII. <i>May a whole church, or the greater part, be
excommunicated?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. To excommunicate is by ministerial
authority to pronounce the person unmeet for christian
communion, as being under the guilt of impenitence
in heinous sin; and to charge the church to
forbear communion with him, and avoid him, and to
bind him over to the bar of God.</p>

<p>2. The pastor of a particular church may pronounce
all the church uncapable of christian communion
and salvation till they repent, e.&nbsp;g. If they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">{688}</a></span>
should all be impenitent Arians, Socinians, blasphemers,
&amp;c. for he hath authority, and they deserve
it. But he hath no church that he is pastor
of, whom he can command to avoid them. 3. The
neighbour pastors of the churches about them, may,
upon full proof, declare to their own churches, that
such a neighbour church that is fallen to Arianism,
&amp;c. is unmeet for christian communion and to be
owned as a church of Christ; and therefore charge
their flocks not to own them, nor to have occasional
communion with their members when they come
among them. For there is authority, and a meet
object, and necessity for so doing; and therefore it
may be done. 4. But a single pastor of another
church may not usurp authority over any neighbour
church, to judge them and excommunicate them,
where he hath neither call nor full proof, as not having
had opportunity to admonish them all, and try
their repentance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_332" id="Ref_332" href="#Foot_332">[332]</a></span>
Therefore the pope's excommunications
are rather to be contemned, than regarded.
5. Yet if many churches turn heretics notoriously,
one single neighbour pastor may renounce their
communion, and require his flock for to avoid them
all. 6. And a pastor may as lawfully excommunicate
the major part of his church, by charging the
minor part to avoid them, as he may do the minor
part; except that accidentally the inconveniences of
a division may be so great, as to make it better to
forbear; and so it may oft fall out also, if it were the
minor part.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCIII. <i>What if a church have two pastors, and one
excommunicate a man, and the other absolve him, what shall the church
and the dissenter do?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> It was such cases that made the churches
of old choose bishops, and ever have but one bishop
in one church. But, 1. He that is in the wrong is
first bound to repent and yield to the other. 2. If
he will not, the other in a tolerable ordinary case
may for peace give way to him, though not consent
to his injurious dealing. 3. In a dubious case they
should both forbear proceeding till the case be
cleared. 4. In most cases, each party should act
according to his own judgment, if the counsel of
neighbour pastors be not able to reconcile them.
And the people may follow their own judgments,
and forbear obeying either of them formally till
they agree.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCIV. <i>For what sins may a man be denied communion, or
excommunicated? Whether for impenitence in every little sin; or for
great sin without impenitence?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. I have showed before that there is a suspension
which is but a forbearance of giving a man
the sacrament, which is only upon an accusation till
his cause be tried; and an innocent person may be
falsely accused, and so tried.</p>

<p>2. Some sins may be of so heinous scandal, that if
the person repent of them this day, his absolution
and reception may be delayed till the scandal be removed.
1. Because the public good is to be preferred
before any man's personal good. 2. And the
churches, or enemies about, cannot so suddenly know
of a man's repentance. If they hear of a man's
murder, perjury, or adultery to-day, and hear that he
is absolved to-morrow, they will think that the
church consisteth of such, or that it maketh very
light of sin. Therefore the ancient churches delayed
and imposed penances, partly to avoid such
scandal. 3. And partly because that some sins are so
heinous, that a sudden profession is not a sufficient
evidence of repentance, unless there be also some
evidence of contrition.</p>

<p>3. But ordinarily no man ought to be excommunicated
for any sin whatsoever, unless impenitence
be added to the sin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_333" id="Ref_333" href="#Foot_333">[333]</a></span>
Because he is first to be admonished
to repent, Matt. xviii. 15, 16; Tit. iii. 10.
And repentance is the gospel condition of pardon to
believers.</p>

<p>4. A man is not to be excommunicated for every
sin which he repenteth not of. Because, 1. Else all
men should be excommunicated. For there are in
all men some errors about sin and duty, and so some
sins which men cannot yet perceive to be sin. 2.
And ministers are not infallible, and may take that
for a sin which is no sin, and so should excommunicate
the innocent. 3. And daily unavoidable infirmities,
though repented of, yet awaken not the soul
sometimes to a notable contrition; nor are they fit
matter for the church's admonition.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_334" id="Ref_334" href="#Foot_334">[334]</a></span>
A man is not to
be called openly to repentance before the church for
every idle word, or hour.</p>

<p>4. Therefore to excommunication these two must
concur: 1. A heinousness in the sin. 2. Impenitence
after due admonition and patience.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCV. <i>Must the pastors examine the people before the
sacrament?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Regularly they should have sufficient
notice after they come to age that they own their
baptismal covenant, and that they have that due
understanding of the sacrament and the sacramental
work, and such a christian profession as is necessary
to a due participation.</p>

<p>2. But this is fitliest done at their solemn transition
out of their infant church state into their
adult: and it is not necessarily to be done every
time they come to the Lord's table (unless the person
desire help for his own benefit); but only once,
before their first communicating: if it be the satisfaction
of the pastor or church that is intended
by it.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCVI. <i>Is the sacrament of the Lord's supper a converting
ordinance?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> You must distinguish, 1. Between the conversion
of infidels without the church, and of hypocrites
within it. 2. Between the primary and the
secondary intention of the institutor. 3. Between
the primary duty of the receiver, and the event.
And so I conclude,</p>

<p>1. That God did not command ministers to give
infidels the Lord's supper to convert them to christianity.</p>

<p>2. He requireth us to give it to none but those
that profess themselves converted from infidelity and
a state of wickedness, and to none that profess not
true saving faith and repentance.</p>

<p>3. God never commanded or allowed any infidel
to demand or receive it to his conversion.</p>

<p>4. God commandeth the pastors of the church to
deliver it to hypocrites, (who at the heart are infidels,
or impenitent and ungodly,) if they profess faith
and repentance, and desire or require it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_335" id="Ref_335" href="#Foot_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>5. There is much in the nature of the sacrament,
which tendeth to the conversion of a hypocrite.</p>

<p>6. And God often blesseth it to the conversion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">{689}</a></span>
hypocrites; so that it may thence be said to be his
secondary intention.</p>

<p>7. But yet he that knoweth himself to be a mere
hypocrite, or void of saving faith and repentance,
should not come first and immediately to the sacrament,
to be converted by it; but should first so long
hear, read, meditate, and pray, till he repent and
believe, and his heart consent to the covenant of
God; and then he should come with penitent contrition,
and solemnly renew his covenant in this
sacrament, and there receive a sealed pardon.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. XCVII. <i>Must no man come to the sacrament, that is uncertain
or doubtful of the sincerity of his faith and repentance?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. He that is sure of his unsoundness and
hypocrisy should not come.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_336" id="Ref_336" href="#Foot_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>2. He that upon trial is not sure, but yet as far as
he can understand his own heart and life, doth judge
himself an impenitent hypocrite, should use other
means to know himself certainly, and fullier to
repent before he cometh. And though some melancholy
and timorous persons be falsely persuaded that
they are impenitent, yet it is better that such forbear
the sacrament, while they use other means for their
better acquaintance with themselves, than that all
the hypocrites, and wicked, impenitent people be
told that it is their duty to come, if they can but
make themselves uncertain whether they be impenitent
or not.</p>

<p>3. But he that after the best endeavours he can use
to know himself, can say, I am not certain that I
truly repent, but as far as I can know my heart I do;
is not to be hindered from the sacrament by that uncertainty.
1. For few of the best attain to a full
certainty of their own sincerity. 2. And all that
can be expected from us is, that we proceed according
to the best of our understandings, and the best
acquaintance with ourselves that we can get. 3.
And otherwise it would keep us from all other duties
proper to true christians; as from thanksgiving for
our justification, sanctification, adoption, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. He that only erreth about the nature of true
faith and repentance, and not about the reality of it
in himself, should not be kept away by that error;
as if he can say, As far as I know my heart, I am
willing to part with every known sin, and to know
every sin that I may part with it; but I am afraid
this is not true repentance; or he that saith, I believe
the gospel to be true, and I am willing to have
Christ upon his covenant terms, and wholly to resign
myself unto him; but I am afraid yet that I am
not a true believer. This person is truly penitent,
and is a true believer, and therefore ought to come.</p>

<p>5. The case <i>de esse</i>, whether a man be a true christian
or not, is in order before the case <i>de scire</i>, whether
he be certain of it, or not.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_337" id="Ref_337" href="#Foot_337">[337]</a></span>
He that is a hypocrite
is bound by God first to know that he is so, and
then to repent, and then to communicate. He that
is sincere, is bound by God to know that he is
sincere, and to be thankful, and to communicate;
and man's neglect of one duty will not make God
change his laws, which still bind them to all this at
once.</p>

<h3>Quest. XCVIII.<i> Is it lawful or a duty to join oblations to the
sacrament, and how?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. There is no question but a christian must
give up himself, soul and body, with all that he
hath, to God for his service; and this oblation is
christianity itself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_338" id="Ref_338" href="#Foot_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It is undoubted that the Lord's day is a fit time
for our depositing what we have to spare for charitable
and pious uses, and this is partly of divine appointment,
1&nbsp;Cor. xvi. 1, 2.</p>

<p>3. No doubt but what we give to the poor, should
be for God's sake, and from our love to God; and
therefore must first be devoted or given up to God,
and but secondarily to the poor.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_339" id="Ref_339" href="#Foot_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>4. It is certain that the Lord's supper is as fit a
season as any part of that day, for such oblations
and collections. The ancient christians did therefore
call it the communion, because in it they showed
their love and communion, and feasted in common
to that end. There are two several sorts of oblations
which may lawfully be made (and fitly) at the communion.
1. The creatures of bread and wine should
be offered or presented before God, as acknowledging
him to be the Creator and Giver of all, and to
desire his acceptance and benediction of them for
that holy use. 2. Our alms or charitable contribution
may be then fitly offered to God, that he may
first accept it, and so it may be communicated to the
church and poor. When we receive from God the
most obliging benefits, when we return our greatest
thanks, when we resign ourselves and all to God, it
is then sure a seasonable time, to express all by the
oblation of our benevolence: that hypocrites may
not pretend that they are charitable in secret, but
the church may have due notice of it, and the pastors
be duly intrusted with it.<span

<h3>Quest. XCIX. <i>How many sacraments are there appointed by Christ?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The word sacrament hath so many significations,
that it is not fit for the question till it be explained.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_341" id="Ref_341" href="#Foot_341">[341]</a></span>
Passing all others now, we must take
notice, 1. That our use of it is not so large as the
Latin interpreter who putteth it for Mystery, but for
A solemn dedication of man to God by a vow expressed
by some sacred ceremony, signifying mutually
our covenant to God, and God's reception of us and
his covenant with us. And it is brought into the
church from the Roman military oath called a sacrament,
in which, as Tertul. "de Cor. Mil." showeth,
the soldier sware fidelity and obedience to Cæsar,
renouncing father, mother, &amp;c. for his service, and
swearing to prefer it, and its safety, before them all:
see Martinius's reciting the oath out of divers
authors. This is our sense of the word; let no man
now that taketh it in other sense, pretend therefore
that we differ in doctrine.</p>

<p>2. Seeing it is no Scripture word, it is not of necessity
to the faith or peace of the church; but when
disputers agree not of the sense of the word, they had
best lay it by, and use such terms whose sense they
can agree on.</p>

<p>3. The name sacrament is either taken from the
covenant sworn to, or from the sign or ceremony of
consent, by which we oblige ourselves, or from both
together.</p>

<p>4. The covenant of christianity is different from a
particular covenant of some office; and accordingly
the sacrament is to be distinguished.</p>

<p>5. As civil, economical, and ecclesiastical offices
are distinct, so are their several sacraments.</p>

<p>6. The solemn renewing of the sacred vow or
covenant, without any instituted, obliging sign, is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">{690}</a></span>
be distinguished from the renewing it by such a sign
of God's institution: and now I conclude,</p>

<p>1. As the word sacrament is taken improperly
<i>secundum quid</i>, from the nobler part only, that is,
the covenant, (as a man's soul is called the man,) so
there are as many sacraments as covenants; and
there is in specie but one covenant of christianity,
and so but one sacrament of christianity, variously
expressed.</p>

<p>2. As the word sacrament is taken properly and
fully according to the aforesaid description; so there
are properly two sacraments of christianity, or of the
covenant of grace; that is, baptism, the sacrament of
initiation, (most fully so called,) and the Lord's supper,
or the sacrament of confirmation, exercise, and
progress.</p>

<p>3. As the word sacrament is taken less properly,
defectively, <i>secundum quid</i>, for the same covenant of
grace or christianity renewed by any arbitrary sign
of our own, without a solemn ceremony of divine institution,
so there are divers sacraments of christianity
or the covenant of grace, that is, divers solemn
renewals of our covenant with God. As, 1. At our
solemn transition from the state of infant membership
unto that of the adult, when we solemnly own
our baptismal covenant, which Calvin and many protestants
(and the English rubric) call confirmation.
2. The solemn owning the christian faith and covenant,
in our constant church assemblies, when we
stand up at the creed or profession of our faith, and
all renew our covenant with God, and dedication to
him. 3. At solemn days of fasting or humiliation,
and of thanksgiving when this should be solemnly
done. Especially upon some public defection.
4. Upon the public repentance of a particular sinner
before his absolution. 5. When a man is going out
of the world, and recommending his soul to God by
Christ; all these are solemn renewings of our covenant
with God, in which we may use any lawful,
natural, or arbitrary signs or expressions, to signify
our own minds by, as speaking, subscribing, standing
up, lifting up the hand, laying it upon a book,
kissing the book, &amp;c. These sacraments are improperly
so called; and are divine as to the covenant renewed,
but human as to the expressing signs.</p>

<p>4. Ordination is not improperly or unfitly called a
sacrament, because it is the solemnizing of a mutual
covenant between God and man, for our dedication
to his special service, and his reception of us and
blessing on us, though imposition of hands be not so
solemn a ceremony by mere institution, as baptism
and the Lord's supper. But then it must be noted,
that this is not <i>sacramentum christianitatis</i>, a sacrament
of the christian covenant; but <i>sacramentum
ordinis vel officii particularis</i>, a sacrament of orders,
or a particular office; but of divine institution.</p>

<p>5. The solemn celebration of marriage, is an economical
sacrament; that is, a solemn obligation of
man and woman by vow to one another, and of both
to God in that relation, which may be arbitrarily
expressed by lawful signs or ceremonies.</p>

<p>6. The solemn covenant of a master with his servant,
is on the same account an economical sacrament.</p>

<p>7. The inauguration of a king, in which he is
sworn to his subjects, and dedicated to God in that
office, and his subjects sworn or consent to him, is a
civil sacrament, whether unction be added or not.
And so is a judge's entrance on his office, when it is
done so solemnly by an obliging vow or covenant.</p>

<p>8. Confirmation in the papists' sense, as conferred
by chrism on infants for giving them the Holy
Ghost, is but an unwarrantable imitation of the old
miraculous operation by the apostles, and neither a
christian sacrament, nor a warrantable practice, but
a presumption.</p>

<p>9. The same may be said of their sacrament of extreme
unction.</p>

<p>10. Their sacrament of marriage is no otherwise a
sacrament, than the inauguration of a king is; which
is approved by God as well as marriage, and signifieth
also an honourable collation of power from the
universal King.</p>

<p>11. Their sacrament of penance is no otherwise a
sacrament than many other forementioned renewings
of our covenant are.</p>

<p>12. Therefore the papists' seven sacraments, or
septenary distribution, is confused, partly redundant,
partly defective, and unworthy to be made a part of
their faith or religion, or the matter of their peevish
and ignorant contendings. And they that peremptorily
say, without distinguishing, that there are but
two sacraments in all, do but harden them by the
unwarrantable narrowing of the word.</p>

<h3>Quest. C. <i>How far is it lawful, needful, or unlawful for a man to
afflict himself by external penances for sin?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Not to the destroying of his body, life, or
health, or the disabling or unfitting body or mind, for
the service of God.</p>

<p>2. Not to be the expression of any sinful, inordinate
dejection, despondency, sorrow, or despair.</p>

<p>3. Not so as may be an outward appearance of
such inordinate passions, or as may be a scandal to
others, and deter them from religion as a melancholy,
hurtful thing.</p>

<p>4. Nor as if God would accept the mere external
self-afflicting for itself, or as if he loved our hurt, or
as if we merited of him by our unprofitable, voluntary
troubles.</p>

<p>But, 1. It is a duty to express true godly sorrow
by its proper exercise and signs, so far as either the
acting of it, or the increase or continuance by the
means of those expressions is profitable to ourselves.</p>

<p>2. And also so far as is needful to the profiting of
others, by showing them the evil of sin, and drawing
them to repentance.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_342" id="Ref_342" href="#Foot_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>3. And so far as is necessary to the satisfying of
the church of the truth of our repentance, in order
to our absolution and communion.</p>

<p>4. Especially so far as is necessary to subdue our
fleshly lusts, and tame our bodies, and bring them
into a due subjection to our faith, and to avoid our
sin for the time to come. And also by the exercise
of sober mortification, prudently, to keep under all
our worldly phantasies, and love of this present
world, without unfitting ourselves for duty.</p>

<p>5. And so far as is needful by such mortification,
to fit us for fervent prayer, especially by fasting on
days of humiliation; and to help us in our meditations
of death and judgment, and to further our
heavenly contemplations and conversation.</p>

<p>6. The greatest difficulty is, Whether any self-revenge
be lawful or due; which is answered by
what is said already; none such as disableth us for
God's service is lawful. But true repentance is an
anger or great displeasure with ourselves for sin, and
a hatred of sin, and loathing of ourselves for it; and
to judge, condemn, and afflict our own souls by a
voluntary self-punishing, is but that exercise of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">{691}</a></span>
justice on ourselves, which is fit for pardoned sinners
that are not to be condemned by the Lord, and indeed
the just exercise of repentance and displeasure
against ourselves.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_343" id="Ref_343" href="#Foot_343">[343]</a></span>
On which accounts of sober
self-revenge we may cherish such degrees of godly
sorrow, fasting, coarse clothing, (as sackcloth,) and
denying ourselves the pleasures of this world, as
shall not be hurtful but helpful to our duty. And if
great and heinous sinners have of old on these
terms, exceeded other men in their austerities, and
self-afflictings, we cannot condemn them of superstition,
unless we more particularly knew more cause
for it. But popishly to think that self-afflicting
without respect to such causes or necessities is a
meritorious perfection, fit for others, is superstition
indeed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_344" id="Ref_344" href="#Foot_344">[344]</a></span>
And to think, as many of the melancholy
do, that self-murder is a lawful self-revenge, is a
heinous sin, and leadeth to that which is more
heinous and dangerous.</p>

<h3>Quest. CI. <i>Is it lawful to observe stated times of fasting imposed
by others, without extraordinary occasions? And particularly Lent?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Remember that I here meddle not with the
question, how far is it lawful for rulers to impose
such fasts on others? save only to say, 1. That it is
undoubtedly fit for kings to do it by precepts, and
churches by consent, in extraordinary cases of defection,
sin, or judgments.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_345" id="Ref_345" href="#Foot_345">[345]</a></span>
2. That it is undoubtedly
sinful usurpation, for either pope or any pretended
ecclesiastical, universal rulers, to impose such
on the universal church (because there are no
universal rulers). Or for a neighbour bishop by
usurpation to impose it on a neighbour church. 3.
And that it is sinful in all or many churches, to make
by their agreements such things to be necessary to
their union or communion with their neighbour
churches, so that they will take all those for schismatics
that differ from them in such indifferent
things. But as to the using of such fasts (omitting
the imposing) I say,</p>

<p>I. 1. That so great and extraordinary a duty as
holy fasting, must not be turned into a mere formality
or ceremony.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_346" id="Ref_346" href="#Foot_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>2. No particular man must be so observant of a
public, commanded, anniversary fast, as for it to
neglect any duty commanded him by God which is
inconsistent with it. As to rejoice or keep a thanksgiving
in Lent, upon an extraordinary obliging cause;
to keep the Lord's day in Lent, as a day of thanksgiving
and rejoicing; to preserve our own health,
&amp;c. It is not lawful in obedience to man, to fast so
much, or use such diet, as is like to destroy our lives
or health; these being not so far put into the power
of man; nor can man dispense with us as to the
duty of self-preservation. If God himself require
us not to offer him our lives and health needlessly,
as an acceptable sacrifice, nor ever maketh self-destruction
our duty, no nor any thing that is not for
man's own good; then we are not to believe without
very clear proof that either prince or prelates have
more power than ever God doth use himself.</p>

<p>3. Such an anniversary fast as is meet for the remembrance
of some great sin or judgment, if commanded,
is to be kept, both for the reason of it, and
for the authority of the commander. For, 1. It is
not unlawful as anniversary. (For, (1.) It is not
forbidden, and, (2.) There may be just occasion.
Some arbitrarily keep an anniversary fast on the day
of their nativity (as I have long done); and some
on the day that they fell into some great sin; and
some on the day of the death of a friend, or of some
personal, domestic, or national calamity; and none
of this is forbidden.) 2. And that which is not unlawful
in itself, is not therefore unlawful to be done
because it is commanded; seeing obedience to superiors
is our duty and not our sin, unless in sinful
things.</p>

<p>4. Whether it be lawful or meet to commemorate
Christ's sufferings by anniversary fasts, is next to be
considered.</p>

<p>II. As for Lent in particular, we must distinguish,
1. Between the ancient Lent, and the later Lent.
2. Between keeping it on a civil account, and on a
religious. 3. Between true fasting, and change of
diet. 4. Between the imitation of Christ's forty
days' fasting, and the mere commemoration of it.
Which premised I conclude,</p>

<p>1. The keeping a true fast or abstinence from
food, for forty days, on what account soever, being
impossible, or self-murder, is not to be attempted.</p>

<p>2. The imitation of Christ in his forty days' fasting
is not to be attempted or pretended to; because
his miraculous works were not done for our imitation.
And it is presumption for us to pretend to such a
power as is necessary to miracles; or yet to make
any essays at such an imitation, any more than at the
raising of the dead.</p>

<p>3. The pretending of a fast when men do but
change their diet, flesh for fish, fruit, sweetmeats,
&amp;c. is but hypocritical and ridiculous; most poor
labourers, and temperate ministers, do live all the
year on a more flesh-denying diet, and in greater abstinence,
than many papists do in Lent, or on their
fasting days. And what a ridiculous dispute is it to
hear, e.&nbsp;g. a Calvin that never eateth but one small
meal a day for many years, to plead against the
keeping of the popish fasts, and their clergy call
him voracious, and carnal, and an epicure, and plead
for fasting as holy mortification, who eat as many
meals and as much meat on a Lent day or fasting
day, as Calvin did in three feasting days; and drink
as much wine in a Lent, as he in twenty years! Sure
I am I know many such on both sides; some that
eat but a small meal a day, and never drink wine at
all, and others that drink wine daily, and eat of many
dishes at a meal, and that to the full, and of the
sweetest, as fish, fruits, &amp;c. yet rail at the former
for not fasting as they do. So delusory are the outward
appearances, and so false the pretensions of the
carnal sort!</p>

<p>4. The ancient Lent consisted first of one day
(Good Friday) alone; and after that of three days,
and then of six, and at last it came up to forty. (Of
which read Dallæus <i>ubi supra</i> at large.)</p>

<p>5. None can question the lawfulness of and obedient
keeping of such a civil Lent fast as our statutes
command, for the vending of fish, and for the breed
of cattle; so be it no bodily necessity or greater
duty be against it.</p>

<p>6. It is not unlawful for those that cannot totally
fast, yet to use more abstinence and a more mortifying
sort of diet than ordinary, for the exercises of
repentance and mortification, in due time.</p>

<p>7. If authority shall appoint such a mortifying,
abstemious course upon lawful or tolerable grounds
and ends, I will obey them, if they peremptorily require
it, when my health or some greater duty forbiddeth
it not.</p>

<p>8. As for the commanding such an abstinence, as
in Lent, not in imitation, but bare commemoration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">{692}</a></span>
of Christ's forty days' fast, I would not command it
if it were in my power; but being peremptorily commanded,
I cannot prove it unlawful to obey, with
the afore-mentioned exceptions.</p>

<p>9. It was anciently held a crime to fast on the
Lord's day, even in Lent; and I take that day to be
separated by Christ and the Holy Ghost for a church
festival or day of thanksgiving; therefore I will not
keep it as a fast, though I were commanded, unless
in such an extraordinary necessity, as aforesaid.</p>

<p>Of pilgrimages, saints, relics, and shrines, temples,
of their miracles, of praying to angels, to saints, for
the dead, purgatory, of the pope's pardons, indulgences,
dispensations; of the power of true pastors
to forgive sins, with a multitude of such cases, which
are commonly handled in our controversial writers
against the papists, I must thither refer the reader
for a solution, because the handling of all such particular
cases would swell my book to a magnitude
beyond my intention, and make this part unsuitable
to the rest.</p>

<h3>Quest. CII. <i>May we continue in a church, where some one ordinance
of Christ is wanting, as discipline, prayer, preaching, or sacraments,
though we have all the rest?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Distinguish, 1. Of ordinances. 2. Of a
stated want, and a temporary want. 3. Of one that
may have better, and one that cannot.</p>

<p>1. Teaching, prayer, and praise, are ordinances of
such necessity that church assemblies have not their
proper use without them.</p>

<p>2. The Lord's supper is of a secondary need, and
must be used when it may, but a church assembly may
attain its ends sometimes without it, in a good degree.</p>

<p>3. Discipline is implicitly exercised when none
but the baptized are communicants, and when professed
christians voluntarily assemble, and the
preaching of the word doth distinguish the precious
from the vile; much more when notorious,
scandalous sinners are by the laws kept from the
sacrament (as our rubric and canons do require).</p>

<p>4. But for the fuller, explicit, and exacter exercise
of discipline, it is very desirable for the well-being
of the churches; but it is but a stronger fence
or hedge, and preservative of sacred order; and both
the being of a church, and the profitable use of holy
assemblies, may subsist without it; as in Helvetia
and other countries it is found.</p>

<p>I conclude then, 1. That he that, <i>consideratis considerandis</i>,
is a free man, should choose that place
where he hath the fullest opportunities of worshipping
God, and edifying his soul.</p>

<p>2. He is not to be accounted a free man that cannot
remove, without a greater hurt than the good,
either to the church or country, or to his family, his
neighbours, or himself.</p>

<p>3. Without teaching, prayer, and divine praises
we are not to reckon that we have proper church assemblies
and communion.</p>

<p>4. We must do all that is in our power to procure
the right use of sacraments and discipline.</p>

<p>5. When we cannot procure it, it is lawful and a
duty to join in those assemblies that are without it,
and rather to enjoy the rest than none. Few churches
have the Lord's supper above once a month, which
in the primitive church was used every Lord's day
and ofter; and yet they meet on other days.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_347" id="Ref_347" href="#Foot_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>6. It is possible that preaching, prayer, and praise,
may be so excellently performed in some churches
that want both discipline and the Lord's supper, and
all so coldly and ignorantly managed in another
church that hath all the ordinances, that men's souls
may much more flourish and prosper under the former
than the latter.</p>

<p>7. If forbearing or wanting some ordinances for
a time, be but in order to a probable procurement of
them, we may the better forbear.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_348" id="Ref_348" href="#Foot_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>8. The time is not to be judged of only by length,
but by the probability of success. For sometimes
God's providence, and the disturbances of the times,
or the craft of men in power, may keep men so long
in the dark, that a long expectation or waiting may
become our duty.</p>

<h3>Quest. CIII. <i>Must the pastors remove from one church to another
whenever the magistrate commandeth us, though the bishop contradict
it, and the church consent not to dismiss us; and so of other cases of
disagreement?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> As in man's soul, the intellectual guidance,
the will, and the executive power do concur, so
in church cases of this nature, the potestative government
of the magistrate, the directive guidance of the
senior pastors, and the attractive love of the people
(who are the chief inferior, final cause) should all
concur; and when they do not, it is confusion: and
when God's order is broken which commandeth
their concurrence, it is hard to know what to do, in
such a division which God alloweth not; as it is to
know whether I should take part with the heart
against the head, or with the head against the stomach
and liver, on suppositions of cross inclinations
or interests; whenas nature supposeth either a concord
of inclination and interest, or else the ruin, sickness,
or death of the person; and the cure must be
by reconciling them, rather than by knowing which
to side with against the rest.</p>

<p>But seeing we must suppose such diseases frequently
to happen, they that cannot cure them must know
how to behave themselves, and to do their own duty.
For my own part, in such cases I would do thus:</p>

<p>1. I would look at my ultimate end, God's glory,
and at the next end, the good of souls and welfare
of the church; and so at the people's interest as it
is the end of the order of magistracy and ministry:
and I would take myself to be so obliged to that end,
as that no point of mere order could disoblige me,
the end being better than the means as such; therefore
I would do all things to edification, supposing
that all power of man is as Paul's was, for edification
and not for destruction.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_349" id="Ref_349" href="#Foot_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But in judging of what is best for the church,
I must take in every accident and circumstance, and
look to many, more than to a few, and to distant
parts as well as to those near me, and to the time
and ages to come, as well as to the present, and not
go upon mistaken suppositions of the church's good;
he that doth not see all things that are to be weighed
in such a case, may err by leaving out some one.</p>

<p>3. I would obey the magistrate formally for conscience
sake in all things which belong to his office;
and particularly in this case, if it were but a removal
from place to place, in respect to the temple, or
tithes, or for the civil peace, or for the preservation
of church order in cases where it is not grossly injurious
to the church and gospel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">{693}</a></span>
4. In cases which by God's appointment belong
to the conduct of bishops, or pastors, or the concord
of consociate churches, I would <i>formaliter</i> follow
them. And in particular, if they satisfy me that the
removal of me is an apparent injury to the church,
(as in the Arian's times, when the emperors removed
the orthodox from all the great churches to put in
Arians,) I would not obedientially and voluntarily
remove.</p>

<p>5. If magistrates and bishops should concur in
commanding my remove in a case notoriously injurious
and pernicious to the church, (as in the
aforesaid case, to bring in an Arian,) I would not
obey formally for conscience sake; supposing that
God never gave them such a power against men's
souls and the gospel of Christ; and there is no
power but of God.</p>

<p>6. But I would prefer both the command of the
magistrate, and the direction of the pastors, before
the mere will and humour of the people, when their
safety and welfare were not concerned in the case.</p>

<p>7. And when the magistrate is peremptory, usually
I must obey him materially, when I do it not formally
(in conscience to his mere command). Because
though in some cases he may do that which
belongeth not to his office, but to the pastor's, yet
his violence may make it become the church's interest,
that I yield and give place to his wrath; for
as I must not resist him by force, so if I depart not
at his command, it may bring a greater suffering on
the churches: and so for preventing a greater evil
he is to be submitted to in many cases, where he
goeth against God and without authority; though
not to be formally obeyed.</p>

<p>8. Particular churches have no such interest in
their ministers or pastors, as to keep them against
their wills and the magistrate's, and against the
interest of the universal church, as shall be next
asserted.</p>

<p>I have spoken to this instance as it taketh in all
other cases of difference between the power of the
magistrate, the pastor's and the people's interest,
when they disagree, and not as to this case alone.</p>

<h3>Quest. CIV. <i>Is a pastor obliged to his flock for life? Or is it
lawful so to oblige himself? And may he remove without their consent?
And so also of a church member, the same questions are put.</i></h3>

<p>These four questions I put together for brevity,
and shall answer them distinctly.</p>

<p>I. 1. A minister is obliged to Christ and the universal
church for life, (<i>durante vita</i>,) with this exception,
if God disable him not. 2. But as a pastor
he is not obliged to this or that flock for life.
There is no such command or example in God's
word.</p>

<p>II. To the second: 1. It is lawful to oblige ourselves
to a people for life in some cases, conditionally;
that is, if God do not apparently call us away. 2.
But it is never lawful to do it absolutely: 1. Because
we shall engage ourselves against God; against his
power over us, and interest in us, and his wisdom
that must guide us. God may call us whither he
please; and though now he speak not by supernatural
revelation, yet he may do it by providential
alterations. 2. And we shall else oblige ourselves
against the universal church, to which we are more
strictly bound, than to any particular church, and
whose good may oblige us to remove. 3. Yea, we
may bind ourselves to the hurt of that church itself;
seeing it may become its interest to part with us. 4.
And we should so oblige ourselves against our duty
to authority, which may remove us.</p>

<p>III. To the third question I answer, 1. A pastor
may not causelessly remove, nor for his own worldly
commodity when it is to the hurt of the church and
hinderance of the gospel. 2. When he hath just
cause, he must acquaint the people with it, and seek
their satisfaction and consent. 3. But if he cannot
procure it, he may remove without it: as, 1. When
he is sure that the interest of the gospel and universal
church require it: 2. Or that just authority doth
oblige him to it.</p>

<p>The reasons are plain from what is said; and also,
1. He is no more bound to the people, than they are
to him; but they are not so bound to him, but they
may remove on just occasion. 2. If he may not remove,
it is either because God forbids it, or because
his own contract with them hath obliged him
against it. But, 1. God no where forbids it: 2.
Such a contract is supposed not made, nor lawful to
be made.</p>

<p>IV. As to the people's case, it needs no other
answer; 1. No member may remove without cause.
2. Nor abruptly and uncharitably to the church's
dissatisfaction, when he may avoid it. But, 3. He
may remove upon many just causes, (private or public,)
whether the church and pastors consent or not,
so the manner be as becometh a christian.</p>

<h3>Quest. CV. <i>When many men pretend at once to be the true pastors of
a particular church against each other's title, through differences
between the magistrates, the ordainers, and the flocks, what should
the people do, and whom should they adhere to?</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">What pastor to adhere to.</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This case is mostly answered
before in Quest. LXXXII. &amp;c. I
need only to add these rules of caution.
1. Do not upon any pretence accept of a
heretic, or one that is utterly unfit for the office.</p>

<p>2. Do not easily take a dividing course or person,
but keep as much as may be in a way of concord
with the united, faithful pastors and churches in
your proximity or country.</p>

<p>3. Look to the public good and interest of religion,
more than to your particular congregation.</p>

<p>4. Neglect not the greatest advantages for your
own edification; but rather take them by a removal
of your dwelling, though you suffer by it in your
estates, than by any division, disturbance of the
church's peace, or common detriment.</p>

<p>5. Do not easily go against the magistrate's commands;
unless they be apparently unlawful, and to
the church's detriment or ruin, in the reception of
your pastors.</p>

<p>6. Do not easily forsake him that hath been justly
received by the church, and hath possession, that is,
till necessity require it.</p>

<h3>Quest. CVI. <i>To whom doth it belong to reform a corrupted church? to
the magistrates, pastors, or people?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> A church is reformed three several ways:
1. By the personal reformation of every member: 2.
By doctrinal direction: and, 3. By public, forcible
execution, and constraint of others.</p>

<p>1. Every member, whether magistrates, pastors, or
people, must reform themselves, by forsaking all
their own sins, and doing their own duties. If a
ruler command a private person to go to mass, to
own any falsehood, or to do any sin, he is not to be
obeyed, because God is to be first obeyed.</p>

<p>2. The bishops or pastors are to reform the church
by doctrine, reproof, and just exhortations, and nunciative
commands in the name of Christ to rulers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">{694}</a></span>
and people to do their several duties; and by the
actual doing of his own.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_350" id="Ref_350" href="#Foot_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The king and magistrates under him, only,
must reform by the sword, that is, by outward force,
and civil laws and corporal penalties: as forcibly to
break down images, to cast out idolaters, or the instruments
of idolatry from the temples, to put true
ministers in possession of the temples, or the legal
public maintenance; to destroy, punish, or hurt idolaters,
&amp;c. Supposing still the power of parents and
masters in their several families.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. CVII. <i>Who is to call synods? princes, pastors, or people?</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">The question of the power of synods is sufficiently
answered before.</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. There are several ways
of calling synods: 1. By force and
civil mandates; 2. By pastoral persuasion
and counsel; and, 3. By
humble entreaty and petition.</p>

<p>1. Magistrates only (that is, the supreme by his
own power, and the inferior by power derived from
him) may call synods by laws and mandates, enforced
by the sword or corporal penalties, or mulcts.</p>

<p>2. Bishops or pastors in due circumstances may
call synods by counsel and persuasive invitation.</p>

<p>3. The people in due circumstances and necessity,
may call synods by way of petition and entreaty.</p>

<p>But what are the due circumstances?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The magistrate may call them by command
at his discretion, for his own counsel, or for
the civil peace, or the church's good.</p>

<p>2. The pastors and people may not call them, nor
meet when the magistrate forbiddeth it, except when
the necessity of the church requireth it: synods may
profitably be stated for order, when it may be lawfully
obtained (both as to limits of place, numbers,
and time). But these prudential orders are not of
stated necessity, but must give place to weightier
reasons on the contrary.</p>

<p>3. Synods themselves are not ordinarily necessary,
by nature or institution; (let him that affirmeth
it, prove it;) but that which is statedly necessary is,
The concord of the churches as the end, and a necessary
correspondency of the churches as the means,
and synods when they may well be had, as a convenient
sort of means.</p>

<p>4. When synods cannot be had, or are needless,
messengers and letters from church to church may
keep up the correspondency and concord.</p>

<p>5. In cases of real necessity, (which are very rare,
though usefulness be more frequent,) the bishops
and people should first petition the king for his consent:
and if that cannot be had, they may meet
secretly and in small numbers, for mutual consultation
and advice about the work of God; and not
by keeping up the formality of their set numbers,
times, places, and orders, provoke the king against
them.</p>

<p>6. The contempt of synods by the separatists, and
the placing more power in synods than ever God
gave them by others, yea, and the insisting on their
circumstantial orders, making them like a civil
senate or court, have been the two extremes which
have greatly injured and divided the churches,
throughout the world.</p>

<h3>Quest. CVIII. <i>To whom doth it belong to appoint days and assemblies
for public humiliation and thanksgiving?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The answer of the last question may serve
for this. 1. The magistrate only may do it by way
of laws, or civil mandate enforced by the sword.</p>

<p>2. The pastors may do it in case of necessity, by
pastoral advice and exhortation, and nunciative command
in the name of Christ.</p>

<p>3. The people may do it by petition.</p>

<p>4. As ordinary church assemblies must be held if
the magistrate forbid them, (of which next,) so must
extraordinary ones, when extraordinary causes make
it a duty.</p>

<p>5. When the magistrate forcibly hindereth them,
natural impossibility resolveth the question about
our duty.</p>

<h3>Quest. CIX. <i>May we omit church assemblies on the Lord's day, if the
magistrate forbid them?</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">May we omit church assemblies on the Lord's day,
if forbidden by magistrates.</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is one thing to forbid
them for a time, upon some special
cause, (as infection by pestilence, fire,
war, &amp;c.) and another to forbid them
statedly or profanely.</p>

<p>2. It is one thing to omit them for a time, and
another to do it ordinarily.</p>

<p>3. It is one thing to omit them in formal obedience
to the law; and another thing to omit them in
prudence, or for necessity, because we cannot keep
them.</p>

<p>4. The assembly and the circumstances of the
assembly must be distinguished.</p>

<p>(1.) If the magistrate for a greater good, (as the
common safety,) forbid church assemblies in a time
of pestilence, assault of enemies, or fire, or the like
necessity, it is a duty to obey him. 1. Because
positive duties give place to those great natural duties
which are their end: so Christ justified himself and
his disciples' violation of the external rest of the
sabbath. "For the sabbath was made for man, and
not man for the sabbath." 2. Because affirmatives
bind not <i>ad semper</i>, and out-of-season duties become
sins. 3. Because one Lord's day or assembly is not
to be preferred before many, which by the omission
of that one are like to be obtained.</p>

<p>(2.) If princes profanely forbid holy assemblies
and public worship, either statedly, or as a renunciation
of Christ and our religion; it is not lawful
formally to obey them.</p>

<p>(3.) But it is lawful prudently to do that secretly
for the present necessity, which we cannot do publicly,
and to do that with smaller numbers, which we
cannot do with greater assemblies, yea, and to omit
some assemblies for a time, that we may thereby
have opportunity for more: which is not formal but
only material obedience.</p>

<p>(4.) But if it be only some circumstances of assembling
that are forbidden us, that is the next case to
be resolved.</p>

<h3>Quest. CX. <i>Must we obey the magistrate if he only forbid us
worshipping God in such a place, or country, or in such numbers, or
the like?</i></h3>

<div class="sidenote">What if we be forbidden only place, numbers, &amp;c.</div>

<p><i>Answ.</i> We must distinguish between
such a determination of circumstances,
modes, or accidents, as
plainly destroy the worship or the end, and such as
do not. For instance, 1. He that saith, You shall
never assemble but once a year, or never but at midnight,
or never above six or seven minutes at once,
&amp;c. doth but determine the circumstance of time:
but he doth it so as to destroy the worship, which
cannot so be done, in consistency with its ends. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">{695}</a></span>
he that shall say, You shall not meet till nine o'clock,
nor stay in the night, &amp;c. doth no such thing.</p>

<p>So, 2. He that saith, You shall not assemble but
at forty miles' distance one from another; or you
shall meet only in a room, that will hold but the
twentieth part of the church; or you shall never
preach in any city or populous place, but in a wilderness
far from the inhabitants, &amp;c. doth but determine
the circumstance of place: but he so doth
it, as tends to destroy or frustrate the work which
God commandeth us. But so doth not he that only
boundeth churches by parish bounds, or forbiddeth
inconvenient places.</p>

<p>3. So he that saith, You shall never meet under a
hundred thousand together, or never above five or
six, doth but determine the accident of number:
but he so doth it as to destroy the work and end.
For the first will be impossible; and in the second
way they must keep church assemblies without
ministers, when there is not so many as for every
such little number to have one. But so doth not he
that only saith, You shall not meet above ten thousand,
nor under ten.</p>

<p>4. So he that saith, You shall not hear a Trinitarian,
but an Arian; or you shall hear only one that
cannot preach the essentials of religion, or that cries
down godliness itself; or you shall hear none but
such as were ordained at Jerusalem or Rome, or
none but such as subscribe the council of Trent, &amp;c.
doth but determine what person we shall hear: but
he so doth it as to destroy the work and end. But
so doth not he that only saith, You shall hear only
this able minister, rather than that.</p>

<p>I need not stand on the application. In the latter
case we owe formal obedience. In the former we
must suffer, and not obey.</p>

<p>For if it be meet so to obey, it is meet in obedience
to give over God's worship. Christ said,
"When they persecute you in one city, flee to another;"
but he never said, If they forbid you preaching
in any city, or populous place, obey them. He
that said, "Preach the gospel to every creature, and
to all nations, and all the world," and that "would
have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge
of the truth,"<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_351" id="Ref_351" href="#Foot_351">[351]</a></span>
doth not allow us to forsake
the souls of all that dwell in cities and populous
places, and preach only to some few cottagers elsewhere;
no more than he will allow us to love, pity,
and relieve the bodies only of those few, and take
none for our neighbours that dwell in cities, but with
priest and Levite to pass them by.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXI. <i>Must subjects or servants forbear weekly lectures,
reading, or such helps, above the Lord's day's worship, if princes or
masters do command it?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. There is great difference between a mere
subject, or person governed, and a servant, slave,
or child.</p>

<p>2. There is great difference between such as are
hindered by just cause and real necessities, and
such as are hindered only through profane malignity.</p>

<p>(1.) Poor people have not so much leisure from
their callings, as the rich; and so providing for
their families may, at that time, by necessity become
the greater and the present duty.</p>

<p>(2.) So may it be with soldiers, judges, and others,
that have present urgent work of public consequence;
when others have no such impediment.</p>

<p>(3.) He that is the child or slave of another, or is
his own by propriety, is more at his power, than he
that is only a subject, and so is but to be governed
in order to his own and the common good.</p>

<p>(4.) A servant that hath absolutely hired himself
to another, is for that time near the condition of a
slave; but he that is hired but with limitations, and
exceptions of liberty, (expressed or understood,) hath
right to the excepted liberty.</p>

<p>(5.) If the king forbid judges, soldiers, or others,
whose labours are due to the public, to hear sermons
at that time when they should do their work,
or if parents or masters so forbid children and servants,
they must be obeyed, while they exclude not
the public worship of the Lord's own day, nor necessary
prayer and duty in our private daily cases.</p>

<p>(6.) But he that is under such bondage as hindereth
the needful helps of his soul, should be gone to
a freer place, if lawfully he can. But a child, wife,
or such as are not free, must trust on God's help in
the use of such means as he alloweth them.</p>

<p>(7.) A prince, or tutor, or schoolmaster, who is not
a proprietor of the person, but only a governor, is
not to be obeyed formally and for conscience sake,
if he forbid his subjects or scholars such daily or
weekly helps for their salvation as they have great
need of, and have no necessity to forbear; such as
are hearing or assembling with the church on the
week days at convenient time, reading the Scriptures
daily, or good books, accompanying with men fearing
God, praying, &amp;c.; because God hath commanded
these when we can perform them.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXII. <i>Whether religious worship may be given to a creature?
and what?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> While the terms of the question remain
ambiguous, it is uncapable of an answer.</p>

<p>1. By worship is meant either <i>cultus in genere</i>,
any honour expressed to another; or some special
act of honour. We must understand the question
in the first general sense, or else we cannot answer
it, till men tell us, what acts of honouring they
mean.</p>

<p>2. By religious is meant, either in general, that
which we are bound to by God, or is done by virtue of
a religious, that is, a divine obligation, and so is made
part of our religion; that is, of our obedience to
God: or else by religious is meant divine, or that
which is properly due to God. The question must
be taken in the first general sense; or else it is no
question, but ridiculous (to ask whether we may
give God's proper worship to a creature).</p>

<p>And so I answer, 1. By way of distinction. 2. Of
solution.</p>

<p>(1.) We must distinguish between the honour of
worshipping acts of the mind, and of the body. (2.)
Between idolatry as against the first commandment,
and idolatry or scandal as against the second.</p>

<p><i>Af. Prop.</i> 1. There is due to every creature, a true
estimation of it according to the degree of its dignity
or goodness; and a love proportionable: as also a
belief, a trust, a fear, proportionable to every man's
credibility, fidelity, power, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. There is an eminent degree therefore of estimation,
reverence, and love, and trust, due to good
men above bad, and to those in heaven above those
on earth; and a peculiar honour to rulers as such,
which is not due to their inferiors.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_352" id="Ref_352" href="#Foot_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>3. This is to be expressed by the body, by convenient
actions.</p>

<p>4. The highest honour which we owe to any, is
for the image of God in them; viz. 1. His natural
image, as men. 2. His moral image, as saints. 3.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">{696}</a></span>
His relative image of supereminency, as superiors.
And so it is God in them first, and they next as the
images of God, who are to be honoured.</p>

<p>5. There is no honour to be given to any creature,
but that of which God himself is the end; viz. as it
referreth to his glory.</p>

<p>6. Therefore all honour given to men must be
thus far religious honour (or worship); for as all
things are sanctified to and by saints, so all things
that religious men do, must be religiously done.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_353" id="Ref_353" href="#Foot_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>7. As persons, so places, books, words, utensils,
times, &amp;c. must be honoured for God's sake, as they
are related to God, with such estimations and expressions
as are suitable to their relations.</p>

<p><i>Neg.</i> 1. No creature must be esteemed to be a
god; nor any of God's proper attributes or honour
given to any creature whatsoever.</p>

<p>2. No creature must be esteemed better, or
greater, or wiser, than it is (as far as we have
means to know it).</p>

<p>3. Whatsoever outward expressions of honour (by
word or deed) are appropriated to the true God,
1. By divine institution; 2. Or by nature; 3. Or
by received usage, that expression of honour ought
not to be used to a creature, were the heart never so
free from honouring it. (1.) Because it is bodily
idolatry: (2.) And scandal as being idolatry interpretatively,
in the just sense of others.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_354" id="Ref_354" href="#Foot_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Whatsoever outward expressions of honour
idolaters have used, and do use, to signify their inward
idolatry, or taking a creature or a fiction to be
God, and so make it a <i>tessera</i>, or symbol, or professing
sign of that their idolatry, if those actions are
so used or esteemed among us, or within the notice
of our actions, it is unlawful for us to use the like to
any creature. Because the use of their expression
maketh it to be a profession of idolatry by us, and
so to be interpretative idolatry and scandal; for to
use professing symbols is to profess.</p>

<p>Except when there is some notorious reason to
use the same words or actions to another lawful signification,
which is of greater weight than the scandal;
and we make it as public to obviate the scandal,
that we do it not to the idolater's intents.</p>

<p>For example, If the Mahometans make it a symbol
of their religion, to say, God is but one, upon a
false supposition that the christians make more gods
than one; yet it is lawful for us to use that symbolical
word to a better end. But if they add to their
symbol, and Mahomet is his prophet, we may not
use that, because it is, 1. Symbolical of a false religion;
2. And a falsehood of itself.</p>

<p>So if they make it a distinctive note of their religious
meetings, to congregate the people by voice
and not by bells, when it will be taken for a professing
their religion to do the same, we must avoid
it; but not when there is great cause for it, (as if
we have no other means,) and the reason against it
or scandal may be well avoided.</p>

<p>5. Image worship, (or bowing or otherwise worshipping
towards an image as an object,) in the
time of divine worship, or when we otherwise pretend
to be worshipping God, is so gross an appearance
of inward idolatry, (either as visibly describing
God to be like a creature, or else as seeming to mean
what idolaters did by that action,) that God hath
thought meet to forbid it to all mankind by a special
law. (Command. 2.)</p>

<p>6. The scandal of seeming idolatry is a heinous
sin, and not to be excused by the contrary meaning
of the heart, no more than lying, idolatrous professions
are. Because to blaspheme God as if he were
like a creature, or to tell the world by our actions
that a creature is God, are both very heinous. And
so is it to murder our brethren's souls, by tempting
them to the like.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_355" id="Ref_355" href="#Foot_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>7. It is no appearance of idolatry to kneel to a
king, or a father, or superior, when we are professing
nothing but to honour them with due honour.
But when the church assembleth professedly to
worship God, if then they mix expressions of
veneration to angels, and saints in heaven, or to a
king, or any creature, in their worshipping of God,
without a very notorious signification of sufficient
difference, it will seem a joining them in part of the
same divine honour.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_356" id="Ref_356" href="#Foot_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>8. So we may put off our hats to the chair of state,
or king's image, yea and kneel towards it as to him,
if the command is in due time and place, when it is
human worship only which we profess. But to
kneel or bow as an act of honour towards the image
of king, saints, or angels, in the time of our professed
worshipping of God, is scandalous, and an appearance
that we give them a part of that which we are
giving to God.</p>

<p>9. Yet it is not unlawful even in the sacred assemblies,
to bow to our superior at our entrance, or
going out, or in the intervals of God's worship; because
the time, and custom, and manner may sufficiently
notify the distinction, and prevent the
scandal.</p>

<p>10. If any presumptuous clergyman on pretence of
their authority, will bring images into the churches,
and set them before us in divine worship, as objects
only of remembrance, and means of exciting our
affections to God, that they may show <i>quam proxime
se accedere posse ad peccatum sine peccato</i>, how near
they can come to sin without sin, it is not meet for
any good christians to follow them in their presumption,
nor by obeying them to invite them to proceed
in their church tyranny.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_357" id="Ref_357" href="#Foot_357">[357]</a></span>
Though I now determine
not, whether in case of necessity, a man may not be
present with such a church, if their worship of God
himself be sound, supposing him sufficiently to notify
his dissent, and that he do not himself scandalously
direct his worship toward such images. (As
in the Lutheran churches we may suppose they
do not.)</p>

<h3>Quest. CXIII. <i>What images, and what use of images, is lawful or
unlawful?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is unlawful to make any image of
God. Because it would be a blaspheming of him,
as pretending him to be like to that which he is not
like to, that is, a creature.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_358" id="Ref_358" href="#Foot_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Man is God's image: it is lawful to make
an image of man; and so an image of God's image,
and that may be a secondary image of God.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is the soul of man, of which no image
can be drawn or made, which is the image of God,
and not the body. 2. The image of him who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">{697}</a></span>
<i>secundum quid</i> as to the soul is God's image, is not
God's image, but man's <i>quoad corpus</i> as to another
part. We need not contend much about the name,
whether this may be called a remote image of God
(though undoubtedly unfit). But we must not really
take it to be like him, or use it for his image.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> God hath imprinted his image on the whole
creation; e.&nbsp;g. he is called a consuming fire; therefore
fire may be pictured as his image.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The same answer serveth as to the former
objection. And it is not all the impressions and
<i>vestigia</i> of God's power, wisdom, and goodness, which
are called his image; as the house is not the image
of the builder, or a clock of a clock-maker, &amp;c. And
if God be metaphorically called fire, as he is called a
lion, &amp;c. because of the similitude of some operation
or effect, it followeth not that these are his image;
much less that the image of these is his image.</p>

<p>2. No image may be made to be a teacher of lies;
as we may not lie by words, so neither by images.
Therefore false stories, or false images of realities,
when made as true, and pretended to be true images
or representations, are unlawful.</p>

<p>3. Therefore it is unlawful to make an image of a
spirit, pretending it to be a true image. Because it
will be a lie.</p>

<p>4. It is unlawful so to make, place, or use any
image, as is like to do more harm than good.</p>

<p>5. Therefore it is unlawful so to make, place, or
use them, as that they are like to tempt a man to
any sin, unless necessity for some greater good require
it. (Of which more anon.)</p>

<p>6. Therefore all images of such idols or feigned
deities are unlawful, as are like to be any temptation
to any to believe in them, or worship them.</p>

<p>7. Therefore also all images of such creatures as
others use to give unlawful worship or honour to, are
unlawful when they are like to be a temptation to us
or others to do the like. As among papists the
image of the crucifix, the virgin Mary, and angels
may not be made, placed, or used so as may tempt
any to worship them sinfully as they use to do.</p>

<p>8. The image of an over-honoured or falsely
honoured person, (though not adored,) may not be
so made, placed, or used, as tendeth to tempt others
also to such honour. As of Mahomet, or Apollonius
(as Alexander Severus placed him and others, with
Abraham and Christ, in his <i>lararium</i> or chapel).
And many give too much honour by images to Alexander,
Cæsar, and such other great thieves and murderers
of mankind.</p>

<p>9. It is unlawful to make lascivious images of
naked persons, and place or use them so, as tendeth
to be a temptation to lust or immodesty. A common
sin of persons of unclean imaginations.</p>

<p>10. It is also unlawful so to represent plays,
pompous honours, splendid clothing or buildings, as
tendeth more to tempt the beholders to sinful desires,
than to any good.</p>

<p>11. It is unlawful to place images in churches or
in secret before our eyes when we are worshipping
God, when it tendeth to corrupt the imagination, or
by possessing it, to hinder the spiritual exercise of
the mind. Which is the ordinary effect of images.</p>

<p>12. It is unlawful to use images scandalously, as
any of the aforesaid sinners use them, though we do
it not with the same intent. That is, so to use
them, as is interpretatively or in outward appearance
the same with their use; because by so doing we
shall dishonour God as they do, and harden them in
sin. Therefore images in churches or oratories, in
those countries where others use them sinfully, or
near such countries where the same may harden men
in their sin, is evil.</p>

<p>13. It is unlawful to make talismans or shapes,
upon false suppositions that the very shape naturally
disposeth the matter to receive such influences of the
stars, by which it shall preserve men from plagues,
fire, wild beasts, serpents, diseases, or shall otherwise
work wonders; for which Gaffarel vainly pleadeth at
large; such as they call naturally magical and
charming shapes.</p>

<p>14. Much more unlawful is it purposely to make
shapes to be symbols or instruments by which the
devil shall operate, whether it be for good or evil;
it being unlawful so far to use him.</p>

<p>15. So is it to make such shapes, on conceit that
God or good angels will operate in or by them. As
some use the cross or other images, to defend them
from devils, to cure the tooth-ache or other diseases,
or such like use; when God hath neither appointed
any such means to be used, for such ends, nor promised
any such blessing or operation by them.</p>

<p>16. It is unlawful to place the image of a tutelary
saint or angel in house, church, or town, on supposition
that we shall be the safer while that image is
there placed; or else to profess our trust in that
particular guardian. Because no man knoweth what
angel God doth make his guardian, nor can we distinguish
them; much less that he maketh such or
such a saint our guardian. And men's own (foolish)
choosing such a one to be their guardian, will not
make them so. Nor hath God appointed or promised
to bless any such imagery.</p>

<p>17. It is sinful to use such amorous images of the
persons towards whom your lust is kindled, as tendeth
to increase or keep up that lust, or to make profession
or ostentation of it. As lustful persons use
to carry or keep the pictures of those on whom they
dote.</p>

<p>18. It is unlawful to make such use of the pictures
of our deceased friends, as tendeth to increase our
inordinate sorrow for them.</p>

<p>19. It is unlawful to make such images, monuments,
or memorials of the best and holiest persons
or martyrs, as may endanger or tempt men to any
inordinate veneration of, or confidence in the persons
honoured.</p>

<p>20. Inward images of God imprinted on the fantasy
are sinful: and so are other such false and sinful
images as afore-mentioned, though they be not made
externally for the use of the eye.</p>

<p>21. I think it is unlawful to make an image, or
any equal instituted sign, to be the public common
symbol of the christian religion (though it be but a
professing sign); because God having already instituted
the symbols or public <i>tesseræ</i> of our christian
profession or religion, it is usurpation to do the like
without his commission. As the king having made
the wearing of a George and star the badge of the
order of the garter, would take it ill, if any shall
make another badge of the order, much more if they
impose it on all of the order: though I presume not
to condemn it.</p>

<p>1. All images painted or engraven are not unlawful;
for God himself commanded and allowed the
use of many in the Old Testament. And Christ reprehendeth
not Cæsar's image on his coin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_359" id="Ref_359" href="#Foot_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The civil use of images in coins, sign-posts,
banners, ornaments of buildings, or of books, or
chambers, or gardens, is not unlawful.</p>

<p>3. As the word image is taken in general for signs,
there is no question but they are frequently to be
used; as all a man's words are the images, that is,
the signifiers of his mind; and all a man's writings
are the same made visible. It is therefore a blind,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">{698}</a></span>
confounding error of some now among us (otherwise
very sober, good men) who accuse all forms of prayer
and of preaching as sinful, because (say they) they
are idols, or images of prayer and of preaching; they
are neither engraven nor painted images of any
creature; but all words are or should be signs of the
speaker's mind. And if you will <i>secundum quid</i> call
only the inward desires by the name of prayer, then
the words are the signs of such prayer. But because
prayer in the full sense is desire expressed, therefore
the expressions are not the signs of such prayer, but
part of the prayer itself, as the body is of the man:
nor is a form, that is fore-conceived or premeditated
words, (whether in mind or writing,) any more an
image of prayer, than extemporate prayer is. All
words are signs, but never the more for being premeditated
or written. And according to this opinion,
all books are sinful images, and all sermon notes,
and the printing of the Bible itself, and all pious
letters of one friend to another, and all catechisms:
strangers will hardly believe, that so monstrous an
opinion as this, should in these very instances be
maintained, by men otherwise so understanding and
truly godly, and every way blameless, as have and
do maintain it at this day.</p>

<p>4. The making and using of the image of Christ,
as born, living, preaching, walking, dying, (a crucifix,)
rising, ascending, is not unlawful in itself,
though any of the forementioned accidents may make
it so in such cases. As Christ was man like one of
us, so he may be pictured as a man.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> His divine nature and human soul are
Christ, and these cannot be pictured; therefore an
image of Christ cannot be made.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> It is not the name, but the thing which I
speak of: choose whether you will call it an image
of Christ <i>secundum corpus</i>, or an image of Christ's
body. You cannot picture the soul of a man, and
yet you may draw the picture of a man's body.</p>

<p>5. It is a great part of a believer's work, to have
Christ's image very much upon his imagination, and
so upon his mind.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_360" id="Ref_360" href="#Foot_360">[360]</a></span>
As if he saw him in the manger,
in his temptations, in his preaching, in his praying,
watching, fasting, weeping, doing good, as crowned
with thorns, as crucified, &amp;c.; that a crucified Saviour
being still as it were before our eyes, we may remember
the price of our redemption, and the example
which we have to imitate; and that we are not
to live like a Dives or a Cæsar, but like the servants
of a crucified Christ. A crucifix well befitteth the
imagination and mind of a believer.</p>

<p>6. It is a great part of true godliness, to see God's
image in the glass of the creation; to love and
honour his image on his saints, and all the impressions
of his power, wisdom, and goodness on all his
works; and to love and honour him as appearing in
them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_361" id="Ref_361" href="#Foot_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>7. It is lawful on just occasion, to make the image
of fire or light as signifying the inaccessible light in
which God is said to dwell, and the glory in which
he will appear to the blessed in heaven.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_362" id="Ref_362" href="#Foot_362">[362]</a></span>
For by
many such resemblances the Scripture setteth these
forth, in Rev. i. xxi. xxii. &amp;c. And Moses saw
God's back parts, viz. a created glory.</p>

<p>8. It is lawful to represent an angel on just occasions,
in such a likeness as angels have assumed in
apparitions; or as they are described in Ezekiel or
elsewhere in Scripture; so be it we take it not for
an image of their true spiritual nature, but an improper
representation of them, like a metaphor in
speech.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_363" id="Ref_363" href="#Foot_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>9. It is lawful (seasonably and in fit circumstances)
to use images, 1. For memory, 2. For clearer
apprehension, 3. For more passionate affection, even
in religious cases; which is commonly called the
historical use of them. For these ends the Geneva
Bible, and some other, have the Scripture histories
in printed images; to show the papists that it is not
all images, or all use of them, that they were against.
And so men were wont to picture Dives in his feasting,
with Lazarus in rags, over their tables, to mind
them of the sinfulness of sensuality. And so the
sacred histories are ordinarily painted, as useful ornaments
of rooms, which may profit the spectators.</p>

<p>10. Thus it is lawful to honour the memory of
learned, great, and virtuous persons, saints and martyrs,
by keeping their images; and by the beholding
of them to be remembered of our duty, and excited
to imitation of them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_364" id="Ref_364" href="#Foot_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>11. It is lawful to use hieroglyphics, or images
expressing virtues and vices, as men commonly make
images to decipher prudence, temperance, charity,
fortitude, justice, &amp;c. and envy, sloth, pride, lust, &amp;c.
As they do of the five senses, and the four seasons of
the year, and the several parts of man's age, and the
several ranks and qualities of persons, &amp;c.</p>

<p>12. Thus it is lawful to represent the devil, and
idols, when it tendeth but to make them odious. For
as we must not take their names into our mouths,
Psal. xvi. 4; Exod. xxiii. 13; Eph. v. 3; that is,
when it tendeth to honour them, or tempt men to it;
and yet may name them as Elias did in scorn, or as
the prophets did by reproof of sin; so is it also in
making representations of them. Even as a drunkard
may be painted in his filth and folly to bring shame
and odium on the sin.</p>

<p>13. It is lawful to use hieroglyphics instead of
letters, in teaching children, or in letters to friends;
or to make images to stand as characters instead of
words, and so to use them even about sacred things.</p>

<p>14. As it is lawful to use arbitrary professing signs
even about holy things, which signify no more than
words, and have by nature or custom an aptitude to
such a use; while it is extended no further, than to
open our own minds; so it may be lawful to use such
a characteristical or hieroglyphical image to that end,
when it hath the same aptitude, but not otherwise.
As a circular figure or ring being a hieroglyphic of
perpetuity, and so of constancy, is used as a significant
profession of constancy in marriage; and so the
receiving of each other's picture might be used. And
so in covenanting, or taking an oath, the professing
sign is left to the custom of the country; whether
we signify our consent by gesture, words, action,
writing. And as it is lawful to make an image on a
seal which hath a sacred signification, (as a flaming
heart on an altar, a Bible, a praying saint, &amp;c.) as
well as to write a religious motto on a seal; so it is
lawful to put this seal to a subscribed covenant with
God and his church, or our king and country, when
we have a lawful call to seal such a covenant.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_365" id="Ref_365" href="#Foot_365">[365]</a></span>
But
if law or custom would make such a seal to be the
common public badge or symbol of the christian religion,
I think it would become unlawful.</p>

<p>As the crucifix for aught I know might thus have
been arbitrarily used as a seal, or as a transient, arbitrary
professing sign, as the cross was by the ancients
at the beginning. If any man had scorned me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">{699}</a></span>
for believing in a crucified Christ, I know not but I
might have made a crucifix by art, act, or gesture, to
tell him that I am not ashamed of Christ; as well as
I may tell him so by word of mouth. But if men's
institution or custom shall make this a symbol or
badge of a christian, and twist it in baptism, or adjoin
it, as a dedicating sign, and as the common professing
symbol that every baptized person must use,
to signify and declare that he is not ashamed of
Christ crucified, but believeth in him, and will manfully
fight under his banner against the flesh, the
world, and the devil to the death: though he call it
but a professing sign, and say, he doth but signify
his own mind, and not God's act and grace; I should
wish to distinguish between a private or arbitrary
act of profession, and a common public badge
and professing symbol of our religion; and tell him
that I think the instituting of the latter belongs to
God alone; and that he hath made two sacraments
to that end; which sacraments are essentially such
symbols and badges of our profession, and are dedicating
signs on the receiver's part; and that Christ
crucified is the chief grace or mercy given to the
church, and his sacrifice is his own act: and therefore
objectively, the grace, and act of God also, is
here signified; and therefore on two accounts set
together, I fear this use of the crucifix is a sin: 1. As
it is an image, (though it should be transient,) used
as a medium in God's worship, and so forbidden in
the second commandment (for it is not a mere circumstance
of worship, but an outward act of worship).
2. Because it is a new human sacrament, or
hath too much of the essence of a sacrament, and so
is a usurpation of his prerogative that made the
sacraments: for as I said, it belongeth to the king
to make the common badge or symbol of his own
subjects, or any order honoured by him. And the
general giveth out his own colours; and though
one may arbitrarily wear another colour, yet if
any shall give out common colours to his army,
regiment, or troop beside his own, to be the symbol
or badge of his soldiers, I think he would take it for
too much boldness. Yet if only an inferior captain
gave but subordinate colours, not to notify a soldier
of the army as such, but to distinguish his troop from
the rest, it were not so much as the other: so if a
bishop or ruler did but make such a symbol by which
the christians of his charge might be discerned from
all others, and not as a badge of christianity itself,
though I know no reason for such distinction, and it
may be faulty otherwise, yet would it not be this
usurping of sacramental institution, which now I
speak of. All professing signs are not symbols of christianity.
Christ hath done his own work well already;
his colours, sacraments, or symbols are sufficient; we
need not devise more, and accuse his institutions of
insufficiency; nor make more work for ourselves in
religion, when we leave undone so much that he
hath made us.</p>

<p>15. All abuse of images will not warrant us to
separate from the church which abuseth them; nor
is all such abuse, idolatry. If the church or our
rulers will against our will place images inconveniently
in churches, we may lawfully be there, so that
they be not symbols of idol worship, or of a religion
or worship so sinful in the substance, as that God
will not accept it; and so be it we make no sinful
use of those inconvenient images ourselves. Though
mere temptation and scandal make them sinful in
those that so abuse them, and set them up; yet he
that is not the author of that temptation or scandal,
may not forsake God's worship, because that such
things are present, nor is to be interpreted a consenter
to them, while he cometh only about lawful
worship (and perhaps hath fit opportunity at other
times to profess his dissent).</p>

<p>16. It is lawful to preserve the honest and sober
love to our friends, by keeping their pictures; or to
show our love by decent monuments.</p>

<p>17. Where we may use creatures themselves to
profit us by the sight, we may (ordinarily) use the
images of those creatures. As the sight of trees,
fruits, cities, &amp;c. may delight us, and mind us of the
power, wisdom, and goodness of God (or the sight of
the sun, moon, stars, &amp;c.); so may the pictures of
the same things. And as a dead body, skeleton, or
skull, may profitably mind us of our latter end; so
may the picture of any of these, which we may more
conveniently keep.</p>

<p>18. It is not unlawful to pray before or towards an
image, in a room where images are placed only for
ornament, and we have no respect to them as a medium
or object of our worship (except by accident
as aforesaid).</p>

<p>19. It is not unlawful to make an image (out of the
cases of accidental evil before named) to be <i>objectum
vel medium excitans ad cultum Dei</i>, an object or medium
of our consideration, exciting our minds to worship
God. (As a death's-head, or a crucifix, or an historical
image of Christ or some holy man, yea, the
sight of any of God's creatures, may be so holily
used, as to stir up in us a worshipping affection, and
so is <i>medium cultus excitans vel efficienter</i>.) But no
creature, or image, (I think,) may lawfully be made
the <i>medium cultum vel terminus, in genere causæ
finalis</i>, a worshipped medium, or the <i>terminus</i>, or the
thing which we worship mediately, on pretence of
representing God, and that we worship him in it ultimately.
And this I take to be the thing forbidden
directly in the second commandment; viz. To worship
a creature (with mind or body) in the act of
divine worship, as representing God, or as the mediate
term of our worship, by which we send it unto
God, as if it were the more acceptable to him. So
that it is lawful by the sight of a crucifix to be provoked
to worship God; but it is unlawful to offer
him that worship, by offering it to the crucifix first,
as the sign, way, or means of our sending it to God.</p>

<p>20. Yet a creature may be honoured or worshipped
with such worship as is due to him, by the
means of such a representing <i>terminus</i> or image. If
the king command his subjects to bow towards his
image or throne when he is absent, as an act of
honour, or human worship to himself, it is lawful so
to do, God having not forbid it. But God hath forbid
us to do so by himself, because he hath no image,
and is confined to no place, and to avoid the danger
and appearance of idolatry.</p>

<p>21. Yet is it lawful to lift up our hand and eyes
towards heaven, as the place of God's glory; and I
condemn not the ancient churches that worshipped
towards the east. But it was not heaven, or the sun,
or east that they worshipped, or to which they sent
their worship, as any <i>terminus medius</i>, or thing
mediately worshipped; but only to God himself,
whose glory is in the heavens.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXIV. <i>Whether stage-plays, where the virtuous and vicious
are personated, be lawful?</i></h3>

<p>Because this is a kind of imagery, the question
may be here fitly handled. But I have said so much
before of stage-plays, and the sin that is used in them,
part i. chap. 18, that I have nothing more to say
here, but only to decide this particular case of conscience
concerning them.</p>

<p>As I am not willing to thrust any man into extremes,
nor to trouble men with calling those sins,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">{700}</a></span>
which God hath not forbidden; so I have reason to
advise men to go, in doubtful cases, on the safer side,
much more to dissuade them from undoubted sin,
and especially from great and multiplied sins; and
therefore I must thus decide the question.</p>

<p>1. It is not absolutely unlawful to personate
another man, nor doth the second commandment forbid
such living images in this extent. I pass by the
instance of the woman of Tekoah, 2&nbsp;Sam. xiv.; because
the bare history proveth not the lawfulness.
But Paul's speaking as of himself and Apollos the
things which concerned others, was approvable;
and as Christ frequently taught by parables, so his
parables were a description of good and evil, by the
way of feigned history, as if such and such things
had been done by such persons as never were. And
this fiction is no falsehood; for the hearer knoweth
that it is not meant as an historical narrative,
but a parable; and it is but an image in words,
or a painted doctrine. And if a person and action
may be feigned by words, I know not where it is
forbidden to feign them by personal representation.
Therefore to personate another is not simply
a sin.</p>

<p>2. To personate good men in good actions, is not
simply unlawful; because, 1. It is not unlawful as it
is personating, as is showed. 2. Nor as lying; because
it is not an asserting, but a representing; nor
so taken.</p>

<p>3. To personate a bad man, in a bad action, is
more dubious; but seemeth not in all cases to be
unlawful. To pass by David's feigning himself mad,
(as of uncertain quality,) it is common with preachers,
to speak oft the words of wicked men, as in
their names or persons, to disgrace them: and Prov.
v. 11, 12, &amp;c. cometh near it. And whether Job be
a history, or a dialogue personating such speakers,
is doubted by the most learned expositors.</p>

<p>4. I think it possible to devise and act a comedy
or tragedy, which should be lawful, and very edifying.
It might be so ordered by wise men.</p>

<p>5. I think I never knew or heard of a lawful stage-play,
comedy, or tragedy, in the age that I have
lived in; and that those now commonly used, are
not only sins, but heinous, aggravated sins; for these
reasons.</p>

<p>1. They personate odious vices commonly viciously;
that is, 1. Without need, reciting sinful words,
and representing sinful actions; which as they were
evil in the first committing, so are they in the needless
repetition. Eph. v. 3, 4, 12, "But fornication, and
all uncleanness, or covetousness, (or lust,) let it not
be once named among you as becometh saints;
neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting,
which are not convenient; but rather giving of
thanks.&mdash;For it is a shame even to speak of those
things which are done of them in secret." 2. Because
they are spoken and acted commonly without
that shame, and hatred, and grief which should rightly
affect the hearers with an abhorrence of them;
and therefore tend to reconcile men to sin, and to
tempt them to take it but for a matter of sport.</p>

<p>2. There are usually so many words materially
false (though not proper lies) used in such actings
of good and evil, as is unsavoury, and tendeth to
tempt men to fiction and false speaking.</p>

<p>3. There are usually such multitudes of vain words
poured out on the circumstantials, as are a sin themselves,
and tempt the hearers to the like.</p>

<p>4. They usually mix such amorous or other such
insnaring expressions or actions, as are fitted to
kindle men's sinful lusts, and to be temptations to
the evils which they pretend to cure.</p>

<p>5. A great deal of precious time is wasted in them,
which might have been much better spent; to all
the lawful ends which they can intend.</p>

<p>6. It is the preferring of an unmeet and dangerous
recreation, before many fitter; God having allowed
us so great choice of better, it cannot be lawful to
choose a worse. The body which most needeth exercise,
with most of the spectators, hath no exercise
at all; and the mind might be much more fruitfully
recreated many ways, by variety of books, of converse,
by contemplating God and his works, by the
fore-thoughts of the heavenly glory, &amp;c. So that it
is unlawful, as unfitted to its pretended ends.</p>

<p>7. It usually best suiteth with the most carnal
minds, and more corrupteth the affections and passions,
as full experience proveth: those that most
love and use them are not reformed by them, but
commonly are the most loose, ungodly, sensual
people.</p>

<p>8. The best and wisest persons least relish them,
and are commonly most against them. And they
are best able to make experiment, what doth most
help or hurt the soul. Therefore when the sensual
say, We profit by them, as much as by sermons, they
do but speak according to their sense and lust. As
one that hath the green-sickness may say, coals and
clay and ashes do more good than meat; because
they are not so fit to judge, as those that have a
healthful state and appetite. And it seldom pleaseth
the conscience of a dying man, to remember the
time he spent at stage-plays.</p>

<p>9. Usually there is much cost bestowed on them,
which might be better employed, and therefore is
unlawful.</p>

<p>10. God hath appointed a stated means of instructing
souls, by parents, ministers, &amp;c. which is much
more fit and powerful; therefore that time were
better spent.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_367" id="Ref_367" href="#Foot_367">[367]</a></span>
And it is doubtful whether play-houses
be not a stated means of man's institution, set up to
the same pretended use as the church and ministry
of Christ, and so be not against the second commandment.
For my part I cannot defend them, if
any shall say that the devil hath apishly made these
his churches, in competition with the churches of
Christ.</p>

<p>11. It seemeth to me a heinous sin for players to
live upon this as a trade and function, and to be
educated for it, and maintained in it. That which
might be used as a recreation, may not always be
made a trade of.</p>

<p>12. There is no mention that ever such plays were
used in Scripture times by any godly persons.</p>

<p>13. The primitive christians and churches were
commonly against them; many canons are yet to be
seen, by which they did condemn them. Read but
Dr. J. Reignolds against Albericus Gentilis, and you
shall see unanswerable testimonies, from councils,
fathers, emperors, kings, and all sober antiquity
against them.</p>

<p>14. Thousands of young people in our time have
been undone by them; some at the gallows, and
many apprentices who run out in their accounts,
neglect their masters' business, and turn to drunkenness,
and whoredom, and debauchery, do confess that
stage-plays were not the last or least of the temptations
which did overthrow them.</p>

<p>15. The best that can be said of these plays is,
that they are controverted and of doubtful lawfulness;
but there are other means enough of undoubted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">{701}</a></span>
and uncontroverted lawfulness, for the same honest
ends; and therefore it is a sin to do that which is
doubtful without need.</p>

<p>Upon all these reasons, I advise all that love their
time, their souls, their God and happiness, to turn
away from these nurseries of vice, and to delight
themselves in the law and ordinances of their
Saviour, Psal. i. 2, 3.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXV. <i>Is it ever unlawful to use the known symbols and badges
of idolatry?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Ordinarily it is unlawful, as being the
thing forbidden in the second commandment. For
he that useth them, 1. Is corporally idolatrous, whatever
his secret thoughts may be. 2. And he is interpretatively
an idolater, and actually persuadeth
others to be so.</p>

<p>2. But yet though no man may ever use such
symbols of idolatry <i>formaliter, qua tales</i>, as such; yet
materially he may use them in some cases.</p>

<p>As, 1. When an idolater will take an ordinance of
God, and an appointed duty, and turn it into a symbol
of his idolatry (as in the foregoing instance of the
Mahometans). We may not therefore forsake that
duty; but we must do it in such a manner, as may
sufficiently disclaim the idolater's use of it. As if
any idolaters will make a symbol of some Scripture
texts, or of the Lord's day, or of the sacramental
bread and wine, &amp;c. we must not therefore disuse
them.</p>

<p>2. When a thing indifferent is made an idolatrous
symbol or badge, though I must not use it as idolaters
do, yet if any act of Divine Providence make it become
necessary as a moral duty, I may be obliged
to use it, disclaiming the idolater's manner and end:
and then it will be known that I use it not as their
symbol. As if a man, by famine or a swoon, were
dying in an idol's temple, I might give him meat and
drink there to save his life, though such as was a
badge of their idolatry, while I disclaim their ends
and use. The reason is, 1. Because at such a time
it is a natural duty, and therefore may not be omitted
for fear of scandal, or seeming sin, which at that
time is no sin. 2. Because Christ hath taught us in
the instance of himself and his disciples, that positive
commands give place to natural, <i>cæteris paribus</i>.
And that the sabbath was made for man, and not
man for the sabbath; and that we must learn what
this meaneth, "I will have mercy and not sacrifice."
And if we must break the rest of the sabbath for
the life, yea, the feeding of an ox or ass, much more
of a man:<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_368" id="Ref_368" href="#Foot_368">[368]</a></span>
and the positives of the second commandment
must be regulated as the positives of the
fourth. 3. And the scandal in such a case may be
avoided, by declaring that I do disclaim their use
and ends.</p>

<p>In a country where kneeling or being uncovered
to the prince is a civil, honouring custom, if the
prince should be a Caligula, and command the subjects
to worship him and his image as a god, and
make bowing, kneeling, or being uncovered the
badge or symbol of it; here I would ordinarily
avoid even that which before was a duty, because it
was but by accident a duty, and now interpreted a
heinous sin. But in case that the life of any man
lay on it, or that the scandal on religion for my denying
civil honour to the prince, would be greater
and of more perilous consequence, than the scandal
of seeming idolatry, I would perform that civil
honour which I did before, and which God enjoineth
me to perform to my prince. But I would avoid the
scandal, by open protesting (seasonably) against
the idolatry.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. CXVI. <i>Is it unlawful to use the badge or symbol of any error
or sect in the worship of God?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is unlawful to use it formally as such.</p>

<p>2. But not materially, when, 1. There are just and
weighty reasons for it. 2. And I may disown the
error.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Every sect of erring christians accordingly useth
to err in worship, and have some badge and symbol of their sect and error.</div>

<p>For, 1. All sects and erroneous
persons may turn holy words and
duties into symbols of their errors.
2. All christians in the world being
imperfect, do sometimes err in matter
or manner in their worship. And
he that will materially avoid all the badges or
symbols of their errors, shall have no communion
with any church or christian. 3. As we must do
our best so to avoid all their errors, that we choose
them not, and make them not formally our own
practice; (as tautologies, vain repetitions, disorders,
unfit phrases, &amp;c. We must ourselves when we are
the speakers do as much better as we can;) so we
must not therefore separate from them that do use
them, nor deny them our communion when they use
them; else we must separate from all others, and all
others from us. 4. But when we are present with
them, our minds must disown all the faults of the
holiest prayer in the world which we join in: we
may be bound to stay with them, and join in all
that is good and warrantable, and yet as we go
along, to disown in our minds all that we know to
be amiss.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXVII. <i>Are all indifferent things made unlawful to us, which
shall be abused to idolatrous worship?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> You must distinguish, 1. Of the symbol of
idolatry before spoken of, and other by-abuses. 2.
Of an abuse done in former ages or remote countries,
and in our own age and country. 3. Of the
reasons inviting us to use them, whether necessary
or not.</p>

<p>1. The case of symbols or badges is not here
spoken of, but other abuses.</p>

<p>2. An abuse committed in the age and place we
live in, or any other, which will by the scandal imbolden
others to the like, may not be complied in,
without so great reason, as will notably preponderate
the evil consequents.</p>

<p>3. But yet in many cases such abused, indifferent
things, may after be lawfully used by believers.
For instance:</p>

<p>1. Names may be things indifferent, abused to
idolatry, and yet lawfully used by us: as the name
God, <i>Deus</i>, Lord, holy, just, good, temple, altar,
sacrifice, priest, heaven, sun, moon, Jupiter, Saturn,
and a hundred such; I mean these letters and syllables
in these languages. That these names are all
in themselves indifferent appeareth in that they are
neither naturally necessary, nor by God's institution,
but arbitrary signs of human invention and choice:
for we may easily and lawfully make new words to
signify all the same things that these do: and that
they are abused to idolatry is notoriously known:
and that yet they are lawfully used, the practice of
all christians, English and Latin, even the most
scrupulous themselves, doth judge.</p>

<p>2. And the use of temples (these individuals which
have been used to idolatry) is lawful.</p>

<p>3. So also of bells, pulpits, cups, tables, and fonts,
and other utensils.</p>

<p>4. The Bible itself, as it is this individual book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">{702}</a></span>
rather than another, is a thing indifferent, yet it
may be read in after it hath been abused to idolatry.</p>

<p>5. If the king would not only give the garments,
but the money, lands, lordships, houses, which have
been consecrated or otherwise abused to idolatry, to
any poor people, or most of the scrupulous, they
would think it lawful to receive and use them; yea,
it is lawful to dedicate the same lands and money
afterwards to holy uses, and to maintain religious
worship.</p>

<p>6. Otherwise it were in the power of any idolater
whenever he pleased, to deprive all the christian
world of their christian liberty, and to make nothing
indifferent to us, seeing they can abuse them all.</p>

<p>7. Yea, almost nothing is then already indifferent,
there being few things that some person in some
time and place hath not abused to idolatry.</p>

<p>8. If the question be only of all individual things
abused to idolatry, the decision now given will hold
good; but if it be also of all species of such things,
it will be a dishonour to a man's reason to make a
question of it.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXVIII. <i>May we use the names of week days which idolatry
honoured their idols with; as Sunday, Monday, Saturday, and the rest?
And so the months?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It were to be wished that the custom
were changed; 1. Because the names have been so
grossly abused; 2. And we have no need of them;
3. And as the papists say, Our monuments, temple
names, and other relics among you prove ours to be
the old religion, and keep possession for us till it
be restored; so the heathens say to all the christians,
Your very names of your days and months
prove our religion to be elder than yours, and keep
possession for us till it be restored.</p>

<p>2. It is meet that we wisely do our duty toward
the reformation of this abuse.</p>

<p>3. But yet long custom and sound doctrine hath
so far taken away the scandal and ill effects, that
rather than be an offence to any by seeming singularity,
it is as lawful still to use these names, as it
was to Luke to use the names of Castor and Pollux,
Jupiter and Mercury, historically.</p>

<p>4. In such cases the true solution of the question
must be by weighing accidents and foreseen consequents
together wisely and impartially; and he that
can foresee which way is likely to do most good or
hurt, may satisfactorily know his duty.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXIX. <i>Is it lawful to pray secretly when we come first into
the church, especially when the church is otherwise employed?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. This is a thing which God hath given us
no particular law about; but the general laws must
regulate us, "Let all be done decently, in order, and
to edification."</p>

<p>2. Our great and principal business in coming to
the church assembly is to join with them in the
public worship; and this is it that accordingly, as
our great business, we must intend and do.</p>

<p>3. In a place where superstition makes ignorant
people think it a matter of necessity, so to begin
with secret prayer, when the church is otherwise
employed, the use of it is the more scandalous, as
encouraging them in their error.</p>

<p>4. It is the best way to come before the public
worship begin, and then they that think it most decent
may do it without scruple or just offence.</p>

<p>5. But as a man's heart may put up a short ejaculation
as he walketh up the church, without losing
what else he might hear, so a man may on his knees
be so brief, as that his loss shall be but small; and
whether his profit preponderate that little time's
loss, he can judge better than another. Therefore
though I like best keeping to concord with the assembly
in our devotion, yet these are things in which
it ill beseemeth christians to judge or despise each
other; and I shall take on either side the judging
and despising of those that differ from us, to be a
far greater sin, than the doing or not doing of the
thing.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Is it not called in Eccles. v. 1, 2, "The
sacrifice of fools who know not that they do evil?"</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> No: I have wondered to hear that text so
ordinarily thus perverted. The text is, "Keep thy
foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be
more ready to hear, than to offer the sacrifice of
fools.&mdash;&mdash;" Which is no more, than that it is the
imagination and custom of fools to think to please
God by their sacrifices, and bringing somewhat to
him, while they refuse or neglect to hear his commands
and obey him. Whereas obedience is better
than sacrifice; and the sacrifice of the wicked is
abomination to the Lord: and he that turneth away
his ear from hearing the law, his prayer is abominable:
and because they hate instruction&mdash;they
shall cry and God will not hear them. Therefore
be first careful to hear what God saith to thee, and
to learn his will and do it, and then bring thy sacrifice
to him: leave thy gift at the altar, and go and
be reconciled to thy brother: obey first, and then
come and offer thy gift. This is all the meaning of
the text. See also Psal. l. 8, and compare these
cited texts, 1&nbsp;Sam. xv. 22; Prov. xv. 8; xxi. 17;
Matt. v. &amp;c. But whether we should begin with
prayer or hearing when we enter into the church,
God hath left to prudence to be decided by the general
rules.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXX. <i>May a preacher kneel down in the pulpit, and use his
private prayers when he is in the assembly?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This will have the same answer with the
former; and therefore I shall trouble the reader
with no more.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXI. <i>May a minister pray publicly in his own name singly,
for himself or others? or only in the church's name, as their mouth to
God?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> It is good to be as exact in order and decency
as we can; but they that would not have other
men's ceremonies brought in on that pretence, should
not bring in their own made doctrines.</p>

<p>1. It is certain that all the assembly come thither,
not only to hear a prayer, but to pray as well as the
minister; and therefore the practice of all churches
in the world (as is seen in all the liturgies) is for the
minister to speak in the plural number, and usually
to pray in the church's name. And so he is both
their guide and mouth in prayer. Therefore even
when he prayeth for himself, it is usually fittest
(or very fit) for him rather to say, We beseech thee,
give the speaker thy assistance, &amp;c. than I beseech
thee.</p>

<p>2. And even subjectively it is not inconvenient to
speak of himself in the third person, Give him, or
Give the speaker thy help, instead of Give me.</p>

<p>3. But they that will place a necessity in either of
these, and make the contrary a sin, must have more
knowledge than I have to be able to prove it.</p>

<p>For, 1. In the latter case the minister doth not
pray in his own person, but only for his own person,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">{703}</a></span>
when he saith, We beseech thee, give me thy
help, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. And I know no word of God that saith, either
that the minister is only the mouth of the people, or
that he is to speak only in their names, or that he
may not pray for himself or them in his ministerial
capacity in the first person.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_369" id="Ref_369" href="#Foot_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>For, 1. He is a minister of Christ for the church,
and not the minister of the church properly. And
he is subordinate to Christ in his priestly office, as
well as in his teaching and ruling office: and the
priests did always take it for their office, not only to
speak as the people's mouth, but as sub-mediators or
intercessors for them to God; and as then they were
types of Christ by standing between God and the
people, so they were his officers as well as types;
and so they are his officers to this day: and as they
teach and rule in his name by office, so do they
intercede in his name: all men confess that they
may do this in private; and where is it forbidden to
be done in public?</p>

<p>2. And there are some cases in which it is fittest
that it should be so. That is, when it is supposed that
the congregation doth not join with him. As, 1.
When the whole church is fallen into some error of
judgment, (as who hath not many,) and he knoweth
that they differ from him, it is fitter for him to
pray as a sub-intercessor for them in his own person,
than to speak as in their persons, who he knoweth
join not with him. For that hath a plain untruth in
it. 2. If the whole church be fallen into some little
sin, which seduction yet hindereth them from repenting
of, he were better confess it, and profess sorrow
for it, in his own person, than in theirs that join not
with him in it. 3. When he prayeth for somewhat
for himself and them, that is above their understanding,
(as for direction in some difficult controversies,
&amp;c.) I know not that he is bound to speak in their
names that understand him not.</p>

<p>Therefore this is no business for christians that
are not possessed with a proud, peevish, self-conceited,
quarrelsome humour, to censure or despise a
minister for; nor should any introduce that false
doctrine of man's invention into the church, that the
minister is only to pray in public as the people's
mouth. But the power of prejudice is great.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXII. <i>May the name, priests, sacrifice, and altars, be
lawfully now used instead of, Christ's ministers, worship, and the
holy table?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. He that useth them in design to bring in
the popish transubstantiation and real sacrifice of
the mass, doth heinously sin in such a design and use.</p>

<p>2. In a time and place where they may not be
used without scandal, or tempting or encouraging
any to their errors, the scandal will be a grievous sin.</p>

<p>3. The New Testament useth all the Greek names
which we translate, priests, sacrifice, and altars,
therefore we may use the same in Greek; and our
translation and English names are not intolerable.
If priest come from presbyter I need not prove that;
if it do not, yet all ministers are subordinate to Christ
in his priestly office as essentially as in the rest.
And Rev. i. 6; v. 10; xx. 6, it is said, that we are
or shall be made priests of God, and unto God. And
1&nbsp;Pet. ii. 5, we are "an holy priesthood," and
ver. 9, a "royal priesthood:" if this be said of all,
then especially of ministers.</p>

<p>And the word sacrifice is used of us and our offered
worship, 1&nbsp;Pet. ii. 5; Heb. xiii. 15, 16; Phil. iv. 18;
Eph. v. 2; Rom. xii. 1.</p>

<p>And Heb. xiii. 10, saith, "We have an altar whereof
they partake not," &amp;c. And the word is frequently
used in the Revelation, chap. vi. 9; viii. 3, 5; xvi.
7, &amp;c. in relation to gospel times. We must not
therefore be quarrelsome against the bare names,
unless they be abused to some ill use.</p>

<p>4. The ancient fathers and churches did ever use
all these words so familiarly without any question or
scruple raised about them, either by the orthodox
or any heretics, that at present I can remember to
have ever read of, that we should be the more wary
how we condemn the bare words, lest thence we
give advantage to the papists to make them tell their
followers, that all antiquity was on their side; which
were very easy for them to prove, if the controversy
were about the names alone. Extremes and passionate
imprudence do give the adversaries great
advantages.</p>

<p>5. The names of sacrifice and altar, were used by
the ancient churches, not properly, but merely in
allusion to the Jewish and heathen sacrifices and
altars, together with a tropical use from the christian
reasons of the names.</p>

<p>As the Lord's supper is truly the commemoration
of Christ's sacrifice; and therefore called by protestants,
a commemorative sacrifice; so that our controversy
with the papists is not, whether it may be
called a sacrifice, but whether it be only the sacrament
of a sacrifice, or a sacramental, commemorative
sacrifice, or also a real, proper sacrifice of the very
body and blood itself of Christ. For we acknowledge,
that This is a sacrifice, is no more tropical a speech,
than This is my body and blood.</p>

<p>6. Yet it must be noted, that the Scripture useth
the word sacrifice about ourselves, and our thanksgivings,
and praises, and works of charity, rather
than of the Lord's supper; and the word priests, of
all men, lay or clergy, that offer these foresaid sacrifices
to God. Though the ancient doctors used them
familiarly, by way of allusion, of the sacrament and
its administrators.</p>

<p>7. In a word, as no christian must use these or
any words to false ends or senses, or deceiving purposes,
nor yet to scandal; so out of these cases, the
words are lawful: and as the fathers are not to be
any further condemned for using them, than as the
words (which they foresaw not) have given advantage
to the papists, to bring in an ill sense and doctrine;
so those that now live in churches and countries,
where the public professed doctrine doth free
them from the suspicion of a popish ill sense, should
not be judged nor quarrelled with for the terms; but
all sober christians should allow each other the
liberty of such phrases without censoriousness, or
breach of charity or peace.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXIII. <i>May the communion table be turned altar-wise, and
railed in? And is it lawful to come up to the rails to communicate?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The answer to this is mostly the same with
that to the foregoing question. 1. God hath given
us no particular command or prohibition about these
circumstances; but the general rules, for unity,
edification, order, and decency; whether the table
shall stand this way or that way, here or there, &amp;c.
he hath not particularly determined.</p>

<p>2. They that turn the table altar-wise and rail it
in, out of a design to draw men to popery, or in a
scandalous way which will encourage men to or in
popery, do sin.</p>

<p>3. So do they that rail in the table to signify that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">{704}</a></span>
the vulgar or lay christians must not come to it, but
be kept at a distance; when Christ in his personal
presence admitted his disciples to communicate at
the table with himself.</p>

<p>4. But where there are no such ends, but only to
imitate the ancients that did thus, and to show
reverence to the table on the account of the sacrament,
by keeping away dogs, keeping boys from
sitting on it; and the professed doctrine of the
church condemneth transubstantiation, the real corporal
presence, &amp;c. (as ours doth;) in this case
christians should take these for such as they are, indifferent
things, and not censure or condemn each
other for them; nor should any force them upon
those that think them unlawful.</p>

<p>5. And to communicate is not only lawful in this
case, where we cannot prove that the minister sinneth,
but even when we suspect an ill design in him,
which we cannot prove; yea, or when we can prove
that his personal interpretation of the place, name,
situation, and rails is unsound; for we assemble
there to communicate in and according to the professed
doctrine of christianity and the churches, and
our own open profession, and not after every private
opinion and error of the minister. As I may receive
from an anabaptist or separatist notwithstanding his
personal errors; so may I from another man, whose
error destroyeth not his ministry, nor the ordinance,
as long as I consent not to it, yea, and with the
church profess my dissent.</p>

<p>6. Yet, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, every free man that hath
his choice, should choose to communicate rather
where there is most purity and least error, than with
those that swerve more from regular exactness.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXIV. <i>Is it lawful to use David's psalms in our
assemblies?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes: 1. Christ used them at his last supper,
as is most probable; and he ordinarily joined
with the Jews that used them; and so did the
apostles.</p>

<p>2. It is confessed lawful to read or say them;
therefore also to sing them. For saying and singing
difference not the main end.</p>

<p>3. They are suitable to our use, and were the
liturgy of the Jewish church, not on a ceremonial
account, but for that fitness which is common to us
with them.</p>

<p>4. We are commanded in the New Testament to
sing psalms; and we are not commanded to compose
new ones; nor can every one make psalms, who is
commanded to sing psalms. And if it be lawful to
sing psalms of our own or our neighbour's making,
much more of God's making by his Spirit in his
prophets.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_370" id="Ref_370" href="#Foot_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Object.</i> They are not suitable to all our cases, nor
to all in the assembly.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. We may use them in that measure of
suitableness to our cases which they have. You
may join with a man in prayer who expresseth part
of your wants, though he express not all. Else you
must join with no man in the world.</p>

<p>2. If ungodly men are present when the faithful
speak to God, must we not speak our proper case,
because they are present? The minister in church
administrations speaketh principally in the name of
the faithful, and not of hypocrites. Must he leave
out of his prayers all that is proper to the godly,
merely because some wicked men are there? No
more must the church do in singing unto God.</p>

<p>3. They that cannot speak every word in a psalm
just as their own case, may yet speak it as instructive;
otherwise they might not read or say it.</p>

<p>But the sectarian objections against singing David's
psalms are so frivolous, that I will not tire the
reader with any more.<span

<h3>Quest. CXXV. <i>May psalms be used as prayers, and praises, and
thanksgivings, or only as instructive? even the reading as well as the
singing of them?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The sober reader who knoweth not what
errors others hold, will marvel that I trouble men
with such questions. But I have oft been troubled
with those that (having no other shift to deny the
lawfulness of written and set forms of prayer) do
affirm that psalms are neither to be read or sung at
all as prayers, but only as doctrinal scriptures for
instruction.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_372" id="Ref_372" href="#Foot_372">[372]</a></span>
But that this is false appeareth,</p>

<p>1. In that those that are real, material prayers,
and praises, and thanksgivings, and were penned for
that very use, as the titles show, and those that
were so used by the Jewish synagogues where
Christ was ordinarily present, may be so used by us:
but such are the psalms both as said and sung.</p>

<p>2. And those that we are commanded to sing as
psalms, and have Christ's example so to use, (who
sung a hymn or psalm of praise at his last supper,)
we also may so use: but, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. And those that are by God's Spirit fitted for use
in prayer, praise, and thanksgiving, and never forbidden
so to be used, may by us be so used: but such
are the psalms, &amp;c. I will weary you with no more.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXVI. <i>Are our church tunes lawful, being of man's
invention?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes: they are a lawful invention, allowed
us by God, and fitted to the general rules of edification.
Scripture is no particular rule for such modes
and circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> They breed a carnal pleasure by the
melody, which is not fit for spiritual devotion.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is a lawful sensitive pleasure, sanctified
to a holy use, not hindering, but greatly helping
the soul in spiritual worship.</p>

<p>Either you call it carnal, because it gratifieth the
sinful, corrupt inclinations of man; or only because
it is sensitive, or a pleasure in the imagination and
lower faculties. If the former, 1. There is nothing
in it which is a necessary cause of any sinful
pleasure, nor any impediment to spiritual pleasure.
2. But a lustful person will turn all sensitive
pleasure into sin; our meat, and drink, and clothes,
and houses, and friends, and health: the bread and
wine in the sacrament may be thus abused.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_373" id="Ref_373" href="#Foot_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But you must know, that as our bodies are here
united to our souls, so they act together, and while
the sensitive part is subordinate to the rational, it is
serviceable to it, and not a hinderance: when you
come to have souls that are separated from the body,
you shall use no bodily instruments; and yet even
then it is uncertain to us, whether the sensitive
powers of the soul do not accompany it, and be not
used by it. But certainly in the meantime, he that
will not use sense, shall not use reason. And he
that acteth not sensibly, acteth not as a man: it is
not a sin to be a man; and therefore not to see, to
hear, to taste, to smell, &amp;c. Nor is it a sin to taste
sweetness in our meat or drink; nor is it a sinful
pleasure for the eyes to behold the light, or the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">{705}</a></span>
variety of the beauteous works of God, or to take
pleasure in them. "His works are great, sought
out of all them that have pleasure therein," Psal.
cxi. 2.</p>

<p>You know not what it is to be a man, if you know
not that God hath made all the senses to be the inlets
of objects, and so of holy pleasure into the soul.
Would he have given us eyes, and ears, and appetites,
and made his creatures sweet and beauteous,
that all might either be sin or useless to us? No:
all things are sanctified, and pure to the pure.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_374" id="Ref_374" href="#Foot_374">[374]</a></span>
The
sense is the natural way to the imagination, and that
to the understanding; and he that will have no sensible
and natural pleasure, shall have no spiritual
pleasure: and he that will have none but sensitive
pleasure, were better have none at all. It is therefore
a foolish pretence of spirituality, to dream of
acting without our senses, or avoiding those delights,
which may and must be sanctified to us.
Harmony and melody are so high a pleasure of the
sense, that they are nearest to rational delights, if
not participating of them, and exceedingly fitted to
elevate the mind and affections unto God.</p>

<p>And as it is the very nature of true holiness, to be
so suited to holy things, as that they may be our delight,
and he is the genuine saint, and the best of
christians, who most delighteth in God and holiness;
so that is the best means to make us the best christians,
which helpeth us best to these delights; and
if any thing on earth be like to heaven, it is to have
our delight in God. And therefore if any thing may
make us heavenly, it is that which raiseth us to such
delights. And therefore a choir of holy persons,
melodiously singing the praises of Jehovah, are
likest to the angelical society, Psal. cl.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXVII. <i>Is church music by organs or such instruments,
lawful?</i><span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_375" id="Ref_375" href="#Foot_375">[375]</a></span></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I know that in the persecuted and poorer
times of the church, none such were used (when
they had not temples, nor always a fixed meeting
place). And that the author of the Quest. et Resp.
in Justin Martyr speaketh against it (which Perkins
and others cite to that purpose). And I grant,</p>

<p>1. That as it is in the power of weak, diseased
christians, to make many things unlawful to their
brethren lest we be hurtful to them, and to deprive
us of much, not only of our liberties but our helps;
so in abundance of congregations, church music is
made unlawful by accident, through their mistake.
For it is unlawful (<i>cæteris paribus</i>) by an unnecessary
thing to occasion divisions in the churches; but
where one part judgeth church music unlawful, for
another part to use it, would occasion divisions in
the churches, and drive away the other part. Therefore
I would wish church music to be no where set
up, but where the congregation can accord in the
use of it; or at least where they will not divide
thereupon.</p>

<p>2. And I think it unlawful to use such strains of
music as are light, or as the congregation cannot
easily be brought to understand; much more on purpose
to commit the whole work of singing to the
choristers, and exclude the congregation. I am not
willing to join in such a church where I shall be
shut out of this noble work of praise.</p>

<p>3. But plain, intelligible church music, which
occasioneth not divisions, but the church agreeth in,
for my part I never doubted to be lawful. For, 1.
God set it up long after Moses' ceremonial law, by
David, Solomon, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. It is not an instituted ceremony merely, but a
natural help to the mind's alacrity: and it is a duty
and not a sin to use the helps of nature and lawful
art, though not to institute sacraments, &amp;c. of our
own. As it is lawful to use the comfortable helps of
spectacles in reading the Bible, so is it of music to
exhilarate the soul towards God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_376" id="Ref_376" href="#Foot_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Jesus Christ joined with the Jews that used it,
and never spake a word against it.</p>

<p>4. No Scripture forbiddeth it, therefore it is not
unlawful.</p>

<p>5. Nothing can be against it, that I know of, but
what is said against tunes and melody of voice. For
whereas they say that it is a human invention; so
are our tunes (and metre, and versions). Yea, it is
not a human invention; as the last psalm and many
others show, which call us to praise the Lord with
instruments of music.</p>

<p>And whereas it is said to be a carnal mind of
pleasure, they may say as much of a melodious, harmonious
concert of voices, which is more excellent
music than any instruments.</p>

<p>And whereas some say that they find it do them
harm, so others say of melodious singing; but as
wise men say, they find it do them good. And why
should the experience of some prejudiced, self-conceited
person, or of a half-man that knoweth not
what melody is, be set against the experience of all
others, and deprive them of all such helps and mercies,
as these people say they find no benefit by.</p>

<p>And as some deride church music by many scornful
names, so others do by singing (as some congregations
near me testify, who these many years have
forsaken it, and will not endure it; but their pastor
is fain to unite them, by the constant and total omission
of singing psalms). It is a great wrong that
some do to ignorant christians, by putting such
whimsies and scruples into their heads, which as
soon as they enter, turn that to a scorn, and snare,
and trouble, which might be a real help and comfort
to them, as it is to others.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXVIII. <i>Is the Lord's day a sabbath, and so to be called
and kept, and that of divine institution? And is the seventh-day
sabbath abrogated? &amp;c.</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> All the cases about the Lord's day (except
those practical directions for keeping it, in the Economical
part of this book) I have put into a peculiar
treatise on that subject by itself; and therefore shall
here pass them over, referring the reader to them in
that discourse.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXIX. <i>Is it lawful to appoint human holy days, and observe
them?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This also I have spoke to in the foresaid
treatise, and my "Disput. of Church Government and
Cer." Briefly, 1. It is not lawful to appoint another
weekly sabbath, or day wholly separated to the
commemoration of our redemption: for that is to
mend (pretendedly) the institutions of God; yea, and
to contradict him who hath judged one day only in
seven to be the fittest weekly proportion.</p>

<p>2. As part of some days may be weekly used in
holy assemblies, so may whole days on just, extraordinary
occasions, of prayer, preaching, humiliation,
and thanksgiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">{706}</a></span>
3. The holy doctrine, lives, and sufferings of the
martyrs and other holy men, hath been so great a
mercy to the church, that (for any thing I know) it
is lawful to keep anniversary thanksgivings in remembrance
of them, and to encourage the weak, and
provoke them to constancy and imitation.</p>

<p>4. But to dedicate days or temples to them in any
higher sense, as the heathen and idolaters did to
their heroes, is unlawful; or any way to intimate an
attribution of divinity to them, by word or worship.</p>

<p>5. And they that live among such idolaters must
take heed of giving them scandalous encouragement.</p>

<p>6. And they that scrupulously fear such sin more
than there is cause, should not be forced to sin against
their consciences.</p>

<p>7. But yet no christians should causelessly refuse
that which is lawful, nor to join with the churches
in holy exercises on the days of thankful commemoration
of the apostles, and martyrs, and excellent instruments
in the church; much less petulantly to
work and set open shops to the offence of others;
but rather to persuade all to imitate the holy lives of
those saints to whom they give such honours.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXX. <i>How far are the holy Scriptures a law and perfect rule
to us?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. For all thoughts, words, affections, and
actions, of divine faith and obedience (supposing
still God's law of nature). For it is no believing
God to believe what he never revealed; nor any
trusting God, to trust that he will certainly give us
that which he never either directly or indirectly promised;
nor any obeying God, to do that which he
never commanded.</p>

<p>2. The contents will best show the extent; whatever
is revealed, promised, and commanded in it, for
that it is a perfect rule. For certainly it is perfect
in its kind and to its proper use.</p>

<p>3. It is a perfect rule for all that is of universal
moral necessity; that is, whatever it is necessary
that man believe, think, or do, in all ages and places
of the world, this is of divine obligation. Whatever
the world is universally bound to, (that is, all men in
it,) it is certain that God's law in nature, or Scripture,
or both, bindeth them to it. For the world
hath no universal king or lawgiver but God.</p>

<p>4. God's own laws in nature and Scripture are a
perfect rule for all the duties of the understanding,
thoughts, affections, passions, immediately to be exercised
on God himself; for no one else is a discerner
or judge of such matters.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_377" id="Ref_377" href="#Foot_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>5. It perfectly containeth all the essential and integral
parts of the christian religion; so that nothing
is of itself, and directly, any part of the christian religion
which is not there.</p>

<p>6. It instituteth those sacraments perfectly, which
are the seals of God's covenant with man, and the
delivery of the benefits, and which are the badges or
symbols of the disciples and religion of Christ in the
world.</p>

<p>7. It determineth what faith, prayer, and obedience
shall be his appointed means and conditions of
justification, adoption, and salvation. And so what
shall be professed and preached in his name to the
world.</p>

<p>8. It is a perfect instrument of donation or conveyance
of our right to Christ, and of pardon, and
justification, and adoption, and the Holy Spirit's
assistances, and of glory. As it is God's covenant,
promise, or deed of gift.</p>

<p>9. It instituteth certain ministers as his own
church officers, and perfectly describeth their office,
as instituted by him.</p>

<p>10. It instituteth the form of his church universal,
which is called his body; and also of particular
holy societies for his worship; and prescribeth them
certain duties, as the common worship there to be
performed.</p>

<p>11. It determineth of a weekly day, even the first,
to be separated for and used in this holy worship.</p>

<p>12. It is a perfect general rule for the regulating
of those things, which it doth not command or forbid
in particular. As that all be done wisely, to edification,
in charity, peace, concord, season, order, &amp;c.</p>

<p>13. It giveth to magistrates, pastors, parents, and
other superiors, all that power by which they are
authorized to oblige us, under God, to any undetermined
particulars.</p>

<p>14. It is the perfect rule of Christ's judging, rewarding,
and punishing at last, according to which
he will proceed.</p>

<p>15. It is the only law that is made by primitive
power.</p>

<p>16. And the only law that is made by infallible
wisdom.</p>

<p>17. And the only law which is faultless, and hath
nothing in it that will do the subject any harm.</p>

<p>18. And the only law which is from absolute
power, the rule of all other laws, and from which
there is finally no appeal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_378" id="Ref_378" href="#Foot_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far the holy Scripture with the law of nature
is our perfect rule. But not in any of the following
respects.</p>

<p>1. It is no particular revelation or perfect rule of
natural sciences, as physics, metaphysics, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. It is no rule for the arts, for medicine, music,
arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, grammar, rhetoric,
logic; nor for the mechanics, as navigation, architecture;
and all the trades and occupations of men;
no, not husbandry by which we have our food.</p>

<p>3. It is no particular rule for all the mutable, subordinate
duties of any societies. It will not serve
instead of all the statutes of this and all other lands,
nor tell us, when the terms shall begin and end, nor
what work every parent and master shall set his
children and servants in his family, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. It is no full rule in particular for all those political
principles which are the ground of human
laws; as whether each republic be monarchical,
aristocratical, or democratical; what person or of
what family shall reign; who shall be his officers
and judges, and how diversified; so of his treasury,
munition, coin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>5. It is no rule of propriety in particular, by which
every man may know which is his own land, or
house, or goods, or cattle.</p>

<p>6. It is no particular rule for our natural actions;
what meat we shall eat; what clothes we shall
wear; so of our rest, labour, &amp;c.</p>

<p>7. It is no particular law or rule for any of all
those actions and circumstances about religion or
God's own ordinances, which he hath only commanded
in general, and left in specie or particular
to be determined by man according to his general
laws; but of these next.</p>

promise, threatening, prophecy, or revelation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">{707}</a></span>
falsely to father it upon God, and say, that it is of

duty by Scripture which is not. Or to father apocryphal
books, or texts, or words upon the Spirit of
Christ.</p>

<p>3. To make any law for the church universal, or
as obligatory to all christians; which is to usurp the
sovereignty of Christ; for which treasonable usurpation
it is that protestants call the pope, antichrist.</p>

<p>4. To add new parts to the christian religion.</p>

<p>5. To make any law, which it did properly belong
to the universal Sovereign to have made, if it should
have been made at all: or which implieth an accusation
of ignorance, oversight, error, or omission, in
Christ and the holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>6. To make new laws for men's inward heart duties
towards God.</p>

<p>7. To make new sacraments for the sealing of
Christ's covenant and collation of his benefits therein
contained, and to the public <i>tesseræ</i>, badges or symbols
of christians and christianity in the world.</p>

<p>8. To feign new conditions of the covenant of God,
and necessary means of our justification, adoption,
and salvation.</p>

<p>9. To alter Christ's instituted church ministry, or
add any that are supra-ordinate, co-ordinate, or derogatory
to their office, or that stand on the like pretended
ground, and for equal ends.</p>

<p>10. To make new spiritual societies or church
forms which shall be either supra-ordinate, co-ordinate,
or derogatory to the forms of Christ's institution.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_380" id="Ref_380" href="#Foot_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Any impositions upon the churches (be the

power not derived from God and the Redeemer.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_381" id="Ref_381" href="#Foot_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>12. Any thing that is contrary to the church's

unity, or peace.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_382" id="Ref_382" href="#Foot_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>13. Any unnecessary burden imposed on the consciences
of christians; especially as necessary either
to their salvation, communion, liberty, or peace.</p>

<p>14. And the exercise of any power, pretended to
be either primitive and underived, or infallible, or impeccable,
or absolute.</p>

<p>15. In general, any thing that is contrary to the
authority, matter, form, obligation, honour, or ends
of the laws of God, in nature or Scripture.</p>

<p>16. Any thing which setteth up those judaical
laws and ceremonies which Christ hath abrogated,
in that form and respect in which he abrogated
them.</p>

<p>17. Where there is a doubt among sober, conscionable
christians, lest in obeying man they should sin
against God and disobey his laws, and the matter
doubted of is confessed unnecessary by the imposers:
so infinite is the distance between God and man,
and so wholly dependent on him are the highest, that
they should be exceedingly unwilling to vie with
the authority of their Maker in men's consciences,
or to do any thing unnecessary which tendeth to
compel men to tread down God's authority in their
consciences, and to prefer man's. Much more unwilling
should they be, to silence the sober preachers
of Christ's gospel upon such accounts.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I must entreat the reader carefully to distinguish
here, 1. Between God's law forbidding
rulers to do evil; and his law forbidding subjects or
private men.</p>

<p>2. Between obedience formally so called; which
is, when we therefore obey in conscience, because it
is commanded, and the commander's authority is the
formal reason and object of our obedience: and
obedience material only, which is properly no obedience,
but a doing the thing which is commanded
upon other reasons, and not at all because it is
commanded.</p>

<p>3. Between formal obedience to the office of the
ruler in general, and formal obedience to him, as
commanding this very matter in particular.</p>

<p>4. Between such authority in the ruler as will
warrant his impositions before God for his own justification;
and such authority as may make it my duty
to obey him. And so I answer,</p>

<p>1. We shall not be judged by those laws of God
which made the ruler's duty, but by that which
made our own. It is not all one to say, Thou shalt
not command it, and to say, Thou shalt not do it.</p>

<p>2. Whatever God absolutely forbiddeth men to do,
we must not do, whoever command it.</p>

<p>3. There are many of the things forementioned
absolutely and always unlawful, as being evil of
themselves, which no man may either command or do;
and there are some of them, which are only evil by accident,
which may not be commanded, but may be done
when contrary, weightier accidents do preponderate.</p>

<p>4. Many such things may be done materially on
other reasons, (as for the church's good, the furtherance
of the gospel, the winning of men to God, the
avoiding of scandal, or of hurt to others or ourselves,
&amp;c.) when they are not to be done in formal obedience,
out of conscience to the authority imposing (as if it be
commanded by one that hath no just power).</p>

<p>5. Our actions may participate of obedience in
general, as being actions of subjects, when they are
not obedience in the full and perfect formality as to
the particular. The last leaf of Richard Hooker's
eighth book of Eccles. Polit. will show you the reason
of this. He that hath not just power to command
me this one particular act, yet may be my
ruler in the general, and I am bound to honour him
in general as my ruler; and to disobey him in a
thing lawful for me to do, though not for him to
command, may be dishonouring of him, and an appearance
of disobedience and denial of his power.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_383" id="Ref_383" href="#Foot_383">[383]</a></span>
A parent is forbidden by God to command his child to
speak an idle word, or to do a vain and useless action
(much more a hurtful). Yet if a parent should command
a child to speak an idle word, or do a vain action,
the duty of obedience would make it at that time not to
be vain and idle to him; yea, if he bid him throw away
a cup of wine, or a piece of bread, which is evil when
causeless, the child may be bound to do it: not only
because he knoweth not but the parents may have
lawful ends and reasons for their command, (as to
try and exercise his obedience,) but also if he were
sure that it were not so; because he is a subject,
and the honouring of a parent is so great a good, and
the dishonouring him by that disobedience may
have such ill consequences, as will preponderate the
evil of the loss of a cup of wine, &amp;c. Yet in this
case, the act of obedience is but mixed: it is an act
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_708" id="Page_708">{708}</a></span>
of subjection or honour to a parent, because in general
he is a governor: but it is but materially obedience
in respect of that particular matter, which we know
he had no authority to command.</p>

<p>6. In this respect, therefore, a ruler may have so
much power as may induce on the subject an obligation
to obey, and yet not so much as may justify
his commands before God, nor save himself from
divine punishment.</p>

<p>I add this so distinctly, lest any should misapply
Mr. Rich. Hooker's doctrine aforesaid, Eccl. Pol.
lib. viii. p. 223, 224. "As for them that exercise power
altogether against order, though the kind of power
which they have may be of God, yet is their exercise
thereof against God, and therefore not of God, otherwise
than by permission, as all injustice is.&mdash;Usurpers
of power, whereby we do not mean them that by
violence have aspired unto places of highest authority,
but them that use more authority than they did
ever receive in form and manner, before mentioned.&mdash;Such
usurpers thereof, as in the exercise of their
power, do more than they have been authorized to do,
cannot in conscience bind any man to obedience."</p>

<p>Lest any should gather hence that they are never
bound in conscience to obey their parents, their king,
their pastors, in any point wherein they exercise
more power than God gave them, I thought meet to
speak more exactly to that point, which needed this
distinguishing. For the ground is sure that There
is no power but of God;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_384" id="Ref_384" href="#Foot_384">[384]</a></span>
and that God hath given
no man power against himself, his laws and service;
but yet there are many cases in which God bindeth
children and subjects to obey their superiors, in such
matters as they did sinfully command.</p>

<p>7. It greatly concerneth all sober christians therefore
to be well studied in the law of God, that we
may certainly know what those things are which
God hath absolutely forbidden us to do, whoever
command them, and to distinguish them from things
that depend on mutable accidents; that as the three
witnesses and Daniel, Dan. iii. vi. we may be
true to God whatever we suffer for it; and yet may
obey men in all that is our duty to them.</p>

<p>Thus the apostles knew that no man had power
from God to silence them, or persecute them for the
gospel. Therefore they would not obey those that
forbad them to preach; and yet they would appear
before any magistrate that commanded them, and
obey their summons; and so we may do even to a
usurper, or a private man.</p>

<p>8. The principal and most notable case, in which
we must obey when a ruler sinfully commandeth, is,
when the matter which he commandeth is not such
as is either forbidden us by God, or out of the verge
of his place and calling at all to meddle with and
command, nor yet such as is destructive of our duty
to God; but such as in general belongeth to his
office to determine of according to God's general
rules; but he misseth it in the manner and goeth
against those rules; yet not so far as to destroy the
duty we owe to God, or the end of it.</p>

<p>For instance, it is not in the ruler's power to determine
whether there shall be preaching or none,
true doctrine or false, &amp;c. But it is in his power to
regulate the circumstances of time, place, &amp;c. (next
to be recited). Now if he do these to order, unity,
and edification, I will obey him formally and fully
for conscience sake. If he so do it as is destructive
to the end, (as is aforesaid,) as to say, You shall meet
only at twenty miles' distance, or only at midnight,
&amp;c. I will obey him no further than necessity and
the common good requireth me. If he do it only
with a tolerable inconvenience, (as to say, You shall
meet no where but in the open fields, &amp;c.) I will obey
for conscience sake, as I am in general a subject
bound to honour the magistrate; but not as he nameth
an unmeet circumstance, in that respect my obedience
shall be but material.</p>

<p>I need not handle it as a distinct question, Whether
pastors are to be believed or obeyed any further than
they show a word of God revealing and commanding
the particular thing? Divine faith and obedience is
one thing, and human is another. 1. If as a preacher
he shall say, This is God's word, believe it and obey
it as such, you must believe with a human faith
that it is liker that he knoweth what he saith,
than you do, (unless, (1.) You see evidence; (2.)
Or the consent of more credible persons to be against
him, and then you are not to believe him at all).
Even as a child believeth his teacher in order to learn
the things himself, so you are so far to take his word
while you are learning to know whether it be so or
not. But not to rest in it as certain, nor to take
your belief of him and obedience to him, to be a believing
and obeying God formally, though a duty.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXIII. <i>What are the additions or inventions of men which
are not forbidden by the word of God (whether by rulers or by private
men invented)?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This is handled under the directions for
worship; to which I refer the reader, as also for
part of the answer to the former cases. Yet here I
shall trouble you with so much repetition, as to say,
that,</p>

<p>1. Such inventions and additions are lawful as God
hath commanded men (rulers, pastors, parents, or
private persons) to make under the regulation of his
general laws.</p>

<p>2. All such additions are lawful as are merely subordinate
and subservient to God's laws and orders,
and not forbidden by him, among the forementioned
prohibited additions.</p>

<p>Instances are many. 1. All such modes of a duty
as are necessary <i>in genere</i>, or one way or other to be
determined of, but left to human prudence as to particulars.
As, 1. Whether I shall (this week or month)
publish the gospel by speaking, or by writing, or by
printing. 2. Whether I shall use this method, or that, or
another method in this sermon. 3. Whether I shall use
these phrases and words, or other words. 4. Whether
I shall use notes for my memory or not. And
whether large ones or short ones. 5. Whether I
shall be an hour or two in preaching. 6. Whether
I shall preach with a loud voice or a low. 7. Whether
I shall at this time more endeavour explication
or application, comfort or terror, reprehension or direction,
&amp;c. All which are to be varied by man's
lawful invention according to God's general rules.</p>

<p>2. It is also lawful and needful, that our own invention
or our superior's according to God's general
laws, do determine of the particular subjects of our
office; which Scripture doth not particularly determine
of, viz. 1. Scripture telleth not ministers what
country, parish, or church they shall bestow their
labours in. 2. Nor to how many they shall be a
pastor. 3. Nor what text or subject they shall
preach on. 4. Nor what singular persons they
shall apply comfort, counsel, or terror to, this or that.
5. Nor whom they shall admit to the sacrament
(but by the general rule or description). 6. Nor
whom they shall openly rebuke or excommunicate.
7. Nor whom they shall absolve. It telleth them
not whom the persons be to whom the Scripture
character doth belong, in any of these cases. 8. Nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">{709}</a></span>
whether the witnesses say truly or falsely who
accuse a man. 9. Nor whether the accused be to be
taken as guilty of heresy, scandal, or schism, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. It is also a lawful invention of man, to find,
choose, and use, such natural helps, as are useful to
further us in the obedience of God's laws, and the
practice of his worship, and are not forbidden by
him. Yea, <i>in genere</i> they are commanded, and
yet never particularly determined of in the Scripture:
as, 1. What will clear a preacher's voice,
to speak audibly. 2. The advantage of a pulpit
to be above the people. 3. The use of spectacles
to them that need them to read the Scripture.
4. The translating of the Scriptures into our native
language. 5. Which translation of many we shall
use in the churches. 6. The printing of the Bible.
7. The dividing it into chapters and verses. 8. The
printing of good books, to expound and apply the
Scripture; commentaries, sermons, &amp;c. 9. The
forms of school exercises, disputations, &amp;c. to prepare
students for the ministry; and what books of
divinity tutors shall read to their pupils, or every
student shall have in his library. 10. The manner
and tune of singing psalms in the churches. 11.
What version or metre to use, this or that. 12.
What form of catechism, (verbal, written, or printed,)
to use among many, in the church or family.
13. Whether to pray in the same words often, or in
various. 14. Whether to use words of our own
composing or invention primarily, or of other men's;
and that by direction, persuasion, or command.
15. To use a written or printed form, or neither;
to read it on the book, or speak it by memory. 16.
To use Scripture forms only, of prayer, praise,
psalms and hymns, or those that are of later composure
also. 17. To print the Bible and use it with
marginal notes, and contents, or without. 18. To
baptize in a river, well, pool, or font. 19. To have
sponsors or witnesses of the parents' trustiness, and
the child's covenant, or not. 20. At how many days
old children shall be baptized. 21. Whether they
shall be named in baptism, or before, or after. 22.
Whether one of the ministers shall be a tutor or
teacher to the rest that are younger. 23. How far
the rest shall submit their judgments to one that is
eldest and ablest, and be ruled by him. 24. Whether
there shall be any deaconnesses in the church.
25. Whether a church shall have one minister, two,
or more. 26. Who shall be the men. 27. What
space of ground shall be the church bounds, for the
cohabitation of the members. 28. How many
neighbour churches shall make a synod; and which
be they. 29. How many members a synod shall
consist of. 30. Who shall be president. Or whether
any. And who shall gather the votes. 31.
Who shall record their acts, as scribe. 32. What
messenger shall carry them to the churches. 33.
What letters for correspondence and communion
shall be written to the churches. 34. When pastors
shall remove from one church to another; and to
which. 35. Who shall be ordained ministers to
preach, baptize, and gather churches. 36. How
many the ordainers shall be. 37. Whether there
shall be any music by instruments in the church or
house, for the praises of God; and what. 38. Who
shall lead the psalm. 39. Who shall read. 40. What
words the church's profession of faith shall be expressed
by. 41. By what signs the church shall
signify their consent; whether lifting up the hand,
standing up, bowing the head, or by voice, or writing.
42. By what sign or ceremony men shall take
an oath; whether lifting up the hand towards heaven,
or laying it on a book, or kissing the book, &amp;c. 43.
Whether the people at the sacrament sit near the
table, or keep farther off. 44. Whether it be put
into each person's hand, or they take it themselves.
With many more such like.</p>

<p>4. And it is a lawful invention to determine of
mere circumstances of time and place which God
hath not determined of in Scripture: as, 1. At how
many times in the year or week, baptism shall be
administered. 2. At what age persons be admitted
to the Lord's supper. 3. On what days and hours
of the week there shall be lectures, or church assemblies.
4. How oft and when ministers shall catechise
and instruct the people privately. 5. On what
hour the church shall assemble on the Lord's days,
and receive the sacrament. 6. How long prayer,
reading, and sermon shall be. 7. At what hour to
end the public exercises. 8. At what hours to pray
in families or in secret. 9. How often disciplinary
meetings shall be held, for the trial of accused members.
10. How often synods shall meet; and how
long continue. Of holy days before.</p>

<p>5. The same is to be said for the places of holy
exercises. 1. What edifices the church shall have
for such uses? 2. In what places they shall be
situate? 3. Where the pulpit shall stand? 4. And
where the font? 5. And where the table? 6.
Where each of the people shall sit? 7. Where
synods shall meet? 8. How many temples shall
be in a city? &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. The same is to be said of all accidental, subordinate
officers; as lecturers, clerks, door-keepers,
churchwardens, and many before mentioned.</p>

<p>7. The same is to be said of church utensils; as
table, cups, linen, pulpits, fonts, clock, hour-glass,
bells, seats, decent habit of clothes, &amp;c.</p>

<p>8. The same may be said of decent gestures, not
particularly commanded; as what gesture to preach
in, standing or sitting? What gesture to read in?
What gesture to hear in? What gesture to sing
psalms in? Whether to be covered or bare-headed?
In what gesture to receive the Lord's supper? (In
which Scripture no more regulateth us, than of the
room, the hour of communicating, the number of
communicants, the place; in all which Christ's example
was not a particular law.)</p>

<p>9. The same may be said of order. 1. Whether
the pastor shall begin with prayer, reading, or exhortation?
2. Whether the people shall begin with
prayer or ejaculations privately? 3. Whether we
shall make but one or two long continued prayers,
or many short ones? 4. Whether we shall pray
before sermon immediately, and after, in the pulpit
or in the reading place? 5. When the psalms shall
be said or sung, and how many? 6. How many
chapters shall be read? and which and in what order?
7. Whether baptism shall be before, or after,
or when? 8. When the catechumens and learners
shall be dismissed, and the proper eucharistical
church exercises begin? 9. When collections
made? &amp;c.</p>

<p>But, O Lord, have compassion on thy scattered
flock, who are afflicted and divided by the imperiousness
of those pastors, who think it not enough
for the exercise of their domination, to promote all
thine own holy laws and doctrines, and to make
their own canons in all these cases, or such like;
but they must needs make more work than all this
cometh to, for themselves and for their flocks, even
unto those distractions, and dissipations, and fierce
persecutions and contentions, which many hundred
years have exercised the Greek and Latin churches,
and many more throughout the world.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXIV. <i>What are the mischiefs of unlawful additions in
religion?</i></h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">{710}</a></span>
<i>Answ.</i> Alas! many and great. 1. They tend to
dethrone Christ from his sovereignty, and legislative
prerogative. 2. And to advance man, blind and sinful
man, into his place. 3. And thereby to debase
religion, making it but a human or a mixed thing
(and it can be no more noble than its author is). 4.
And thereby they debase also the church of God,
and the government of it, while they make it to be
but a human policy, and not divine. 5. They tend
to depose God from his authority in men's consciences,
and to level or join him there but with man. 6.
They tend to men's doubtfulness and uncertainty of
their religion; seeing man is fallible, and so may his
constitutions be. 7. They tend to drive out all true
religion from the world, while man that is so bad is
the maker of it; and it may be suspected to be bad,
that is made by so bad an author. 8. And it taketh
off the fear of God, and his judgment: for it is man
that must be feared, so far as man is the maker of
the law. And it destroyeth the consolation of believers,
which consisteth in the hopes of a reward
from God; for he that serveth man, must be rewarded
by man; and though they do not exclude God,
but join him with themselves, yet this mixture debaseth
and destroyeth religion, as the mixture of
God and mammon in men's love, and as mixed and
debased metals do the sovereign's coin. 9. It hardeneth
infidels and hindereth their conversion; for they
will reverence no more of our religion than we can
prove to be divine: and when they find one part of
it to be human, they suspect the rest to be so too, and
contemn it all; even as protestants do popery, for
the abundance of human trinkets and toys with
which we see them exercise and delude their silly
followers. 10. It is the great engine of dividing all
the churches, and breeding and feeding contentions
in the christian world. 11. And because men that
will command, will be obeyed, and they that are absolutely
subjected to God, will obey none against him,
whatever it cost them, (as Dan. iii.; vi.; Heb. xi.;
Luke xiv. 26, 33; Matt. v. 10-12,) therefore it hath
proved the occasion of bloody persecutions in the
churches, by which professed christians draw the
guilt of christian blood upon themselves. 12. And
hereby it hath dolefully hindered the gospel, while
the persecutors have silenced many worthy, conscionable
preachers of it. 13. And by this it hath
quenched charity in the hearts of both sides, and
taught the sufferers and the afflicters to be equally
bitter in censuring if not detesting one another. 14.
And the infidels seeing these dissensions and bitter
passions among christians, deride, and scorn, and
hate them all.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_385" id="Ref_385" href="#Foot_385">[385]</a></span>
15. Yea, such causes as these in the
Latin and Greek churches have engaged not only
emperors and princes against their own subjects, so
that chronicles and books of martyrs perpetuate
their dishonour, as Pilate's name is in the creed;
but also have set them in bloody wars among themselves.
These have been the fruits, and this is the
tendency of usurping Christ's prerogative over his
religion and worship in his church.</p>

<p>And the greatness of the sin appeareth in these
aggravations. 1. It is a mark of pitiful ignorance
and pride when dust shall thus (like Nebuchadnezzar)
exalt itself against God, to its certain infamy
and abasement.</p>

<p>2. It showeth that men little know themselves,
that think themselves fit to be the makers of a religion
for so many others: and that they have base
thoughts of all other men, while they think them
unfit to worship God any other way, than that of
their making; and think that they will all so far
deny God as to take up a religion that is made by
man.</p>

<p>3. It shows that they are much void of love to
others, that can thus use them on so small occasion.</p>

<p>4. And it showeth how little true sense or reverence
of christian religion they have themselves
who can thus debase it, and equal their own inventions
with it.</p>

<p>5. And it leaveth men utterly unexcusable, that
will not take warning by so many hundred years'
experiences of most of the churches through the
world? Even when we see the yet continued divisions
of the eastern and western churches, and all
about a human religion (in the parts most contended
about); when they read of the rivers of blood that
have been shed in Piedmont, France, Germany,
Belgia, Poland, Ireland, and the flames in England,
and many other nations, and all for the human
parts of men's religion? He that will yet go on and
take no warning, may go read the eighteenth and
nineteenth of the Revelation, and see what joy will
be in heaven and earth, when God shall do justice
upon such.</p>

<p>But remember that I speak all this of no other,
than those expressly here described.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXV. <i>What are the mischiefs of men's error on the other
extreme, who pretend that Scripture is a rule where it is not, and
deny the foresaid lawful things, on pretence that Scripture is a
perfect rule (say some, for all things)?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. They fill their own minds with a multitude
of causeless scruples, which on their principles
can never be resolved, and so will give themselves
no rest.</p>

<p>2. They make themselves a religion of their own,
and superstition is their daily devotion; which being
erroneous, will not hang together, but is full of contradictions
in itself; and which being human and
bad, can never give true stability to the soul.</p>

<p>3. Hereby they spend their days much in melancholy
troubles, and unsettled distracting doubts and
fears; instead of the joys of solid faith, and hope,
and love.</p>

<p>4. And if they escape, this their religion is contentious,
wrangling, censorious, and factious, and
their zeal flieth out against those that differ from
their peculiar superstitions and conceits.</p>

<p>5. And hereupon they are usually mutable and
unsettled in their religion; this year for one, and
the next for another; because there is no certainty
in their own inventions and conceits.</p>

<p>6. And hereupon they still fall into manifold parties,
because each man maketh a religion to himself,
by his misinterpretation of God's word; so that
there is no end of their divisions.</p>

<p>7. And they do a great deal of hurt in the church,
by putting the same distracting and dividing conceits
into the heads of others. And young christians, and
women, and ignorant, well meaning people, that are
not able to know who is in the right, do often turn
to that party which they think most strict and godly
(though it be such as our quakers). And the very
good conceit of the people whom they take it from,
doth settle so strong a prejudice in their mind, as no
argument or evidence scarcely can work out; and so
education, converse, and human estimation breedeth
a succession of dividers, and troublers of the churches.</p>

<p>8. They sin against God by calling good evil, and
light darkness, and honouring superstition, which is
the work of Satan, with holy names.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_386" id="Ref_386" href="#Foot_386">[386]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">{711}</a></span>
9. They sin by adding to the word of God; while
they say of abundance of lawful things, This is unlawful,
and that is against the word of God, and pretend
that their Touch not, taste not, handle not, is in
the Scriptures.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_387" id="Ref_387" href="#Foot_387">[387]</a></span>
For while they make it a rule for
every circumstance in particular, they must squeeze,
and force, and wrest it, to find out all those circumstances
in it which were never there; and so by false
expositions make the Scriptures another thing.</p>

<p>10. And how great a sin is it to father Satan's
works on God, and to say that all these and these
things are forbidden or commanded in the Scripture,
and so to belie the Lord and the word of truth.</p>

<p>11. It engageth all subjects against their rulers'
laws and government, and involveth them in the sin
of denying them just obedience; while all the statute
book must be found in the Scriptures, or else condemned
as unlawful.</p>

<p>12. It maintaineth disobedience in churches, and
causeth schisms and confusions unavoidably; for
they that will neither obey the pastors, nor join with
the churches, till they can show scriptures particularly
for every translation, method, metre, tune, and
all that is done, must join with no churches in the
world.</p>

<p>13. It bringeth rebellion and confusion into families,
while children and servants must learn no catechism,
hear no minister, give no account, observe no
hours of prayer, nay, nor do any work, but what
there is a particular scripture for.</p>

<p>14. It sets men on enthusiastical expectations, and
irrational, scandalous worshipping of God, while all
men must avoid all those methods, phrases, books,
helps, which are not expressly or particularly in
Scripture, and men must not use their own inventions,
or prudence, in the right ordering of the works
of religion.</p>

<p>15. It destroyeth christian love and concord, while
men are taught to censure all others, that use any
thing in God's worship which is not particularly in
Scripture, and so to censure all true worshippers in
the world.</p>

<p>16. Yea, it will tempt men at last to be weary of
their own religion, because they will find it an unsatisfactory,
uncomfortable, tiresome thing, to do
their own superstitious work.</p>

<p>17. And they will tempt all that they draw into
this opinion, to be weary of religion also. And truly
had not God's part, which is wise, and good, and
pleasant, prevailed against the hurtfulness of men's
superstition, which is foolish, bad, and unpleasant,
religion had ere this been cast off as a wearisome,
distracting thing; or, which is as bad, been used but
to delude men.</p>

<p>18. Yea, it will tempt men at last to infidelity; for
Satan will quickly teach them to argue, that if Scripture
be a perfect, particular rule, for forty things that
were never there, then it is defective, and is not of
God, but an undertaking of that which is not performed,
and therefore is but a deceit.</p>

<p>19. And the notoriousness and ridiculousness of
this error, will tempt the profane to make religious
people a scorn.</p>

<p>20. Lastly, and rulers will be tempted in church
and state, to take such persons for intolerable in all
societies, and such whose principles are inconsistent
with government. And no thanks to this opinion, if
they be not tempted to dislike the Scripture itself,
and instead of it to fly to the papists' traditions, and
the church's legislative sovereignty, or worse.</p>

<p>But here also remember that I charge none with
all this, but those before described.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXVI. <i>How shall we know what parts of Scripture precept or
example were intended for universal, constant obligations, and what
were but for the time and persons that they were then directed to?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> It is not to be denied, but some things in
Scripture, even in the New Testament, are not laws,
much less universal and perpetual. And the difference
is to be found in the Scripture itself.</p>

<p>1. All that is certainly of universal and perpetual
obligation, which is but a transcript of the universal
and perpetual law of nature.</p>

<p>2. And all that which hath the express characters
of universality and perpetuity upon it; and such are
all the substantial parts of the gospel; as, "Except
ye repent, ye shall all perish," Luke xiii. 3, 5.
"Except a man be born again, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of heaven," John iii. 3, 5. "He that
believeth in him, shall not perish, but have everlasting
life," John iii. 16. "He that believeth and is
baptized, shall be saved, and he that believeth not
shall be damned," Mark xvi. 16. "Without holiness
none shall see God," Heb. xii. 14. "Go, preach
the gospel to all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. teaching
them to observe all things that I have commanded
you," Matt, xxviii. 19, 20. Abundance such texts
have the express characters of universality and perpetuity
(which many call morality).</p>

<p>3. And with these we may number those which
were given to all the churches, with commands to
keep them, and propagate them to posterity.</p>

<p>4. And those that have a plain and necessary connexion
to these before mentioned.</p>

<p>5. And those which plainly have a full parity of
reason with them; and where it is evident that the
command was given to those particular times and
persons, upon no reasons proper to them alone, but
such as were common to all others. I deny not but
(as Amesius noteth after others) many ceremonial
and temporary laws are urged (when they are made)
with natural and perpetual motives: but the reasons
of making them were narrower, whatever the reasons
of obeying them may be.</p>

<p>On the other side, narrow and temporary precepts
and examples, 1. Are void of all these foresaid
characters. 2. They are about materials of temporary
use. 3. Or they are but the ordering of such
customs as were there before, and were proper to
those countries. 4. And many speeches are plainly
appropriate to the time and persons. 5. And many
actions were manifestly occasional, without any intimation
of reason or purpose of obliging others to
imitation.</p>

<p>For instance, 1. Christ's preaching sometimes on
a mountain, sometimes in a ship, sometimes in a
house, and sometimes in the synagogues, doth show
that all these are lawful in season on the like occasion:
but he purposed not to oblige men to any one
of them alone.</p>

<p>2. So Christ's giving the sacrament of his body
and blood, in an upper room, in a private house
after supper, to none but ministers, and none but his
family, and but to twelve, and on the fifth day of the
week only, and in the gesture of a recumbent, leaning,
sitting; all these are plainly occasional, and not
intended as obliging to imitation: for that which he
made a law of, he separated in his speeches, and
commanded them to do it in remembrance of him till
his coming. And Paul expoundeth the distinction,
1&nbsp;Cor. xi. in his practice.</p>

<p>So the promise of the spirit of revelation and miracles
is expounded by the event, as the seal of the
gospel and Scripture, proper to those times in the
main.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">{712}</a></span>
So the primitive christians selling their estates,
and distributing to the poor, or laying it down at the
apostles' feet, was plainly appropriated to that time,
or the like occasions, by the reason of it; which was
suddenly to show the world what the belief of heaven
through the promises of Christ, could make them all,
and how much their love was to Christ and one another,
and how little to the world; and also by the
cessation of it, when the persecutions abated, and
the churches came to any settlement; yea, and at
first it was not a thing commanded to all, but only
voluntarily done.</p>

<p>So the women's veil, and the custom of kissing
each other as a token of love, and men's not wearing
long hair, were the customs of the country there ordered
and improved by the apostles about sacred
things; but not introduced into other countries that
had no such custom.</p>

<p>So also anointing was in those countries taken for
salubrious, and refreshing to the body, and a ceremony
of initiation into places of great honour;
whereupon it was used about the sick, and God's giving
the gift of healing in those times was frequently
conjunct with this means. So that hence the anointing
of the sick came up; and the ancient christians
turned it into an initiating ceremony, because we are
kings and priests to God. Now these occasions extend
not to those countries where anointing neither
was of such use, or value, or signification.</p>

<p>So also Paul's becoming a Jew to the Jews, and
being shaved, and purifying himself, and circumcising
Timothy, are evidently temporary compliances
in a thing then lawful, for the avoiding of offence,
and for the furtherance of the gospel, and no obligatory,
perpetual laws to us. And so most divines think
the eating of things strangled, and blood, were forbidden
for a time to them only that conversed with
the Jews, Acts xv. Though Beckman have many
reasons for the perpetuity, not contemptible.</p>

<p>So the office of deaconesses (and some think of
deacons) seemeth to be fitted to that time, and state,
and condition of christians. And where the reasons
and case are the same, the obligations will be the
same. In a word, the text itself will one way or
other show us, when a command or example is universally
and durably obligatory, and when not.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXVII. <i>How much of the Scripture is necessary to
salvation, to be believed, and understood?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This question is the more worthy consideration,
that we may withal understand the use of catechisms,
confessions, and creeds, (of which after,) and
the great and tender mercies of God to the weak, and
may be able to answer the cavils of the papists
against the Scriptures, as insufficient to be the rule
of faith and life, because much of it is hard to be understood.</p>

<p>1. He that believeth God to be true, and the
Scripture to be his word, must needs believe all to
be true which he believeth to be his word.</p>

<p>2. All the Scripture is profitable to our knowledge,
love, and practice; and none of it to be neglected,
but all to be loved, reverenced, and studied, in due
time and order, by them that have time and capacity
to do it.</p>

<p>3. All the holy Scriptures, either as to matter or
words, are not so necessary, as that no man can be
saved, who doth not either believe or understand
them; but some parts of it are more necessary than
others.</p>

<p>4. It is not of necessity to salvation to believe
every book or verse in Scripture, to be canonical, or
written by the Spirit of God. For as the papists'
canon is larger than that which the protestants own;
so if our canon should prove defective of any one
book, it would not follow that we could not be saved
for want of a sufficient faith. The churches immediately
after the apostles' time, had not each one all
their writings, but they were brought together in
time, and received by degrees, as they had proof of
their being written by authorized, inspired persons.
The second of Peter, James, Jude, Hebrews, and
Revelation, were received in many churches since
the rest. And if some book be lost, (as Enoch's prophecy,
or Paul's epistle to the Laodiceans, or any
other of his epistles not named in the rest,) or if any
hereafter should be lost or doubted of, as the Canticles,
or the second or third epistles of John, the
epistle of Jude, &amp;c. it would not follow, that all true
faith and hope of salvation were lost with it.</p>

<p>It is a controversy whether 1&nbsp;John v. 7, and some
other particular verses, be canonical or not, because
some Greek copies have them, and some are without
them; but whoever erreth in that only, may be
saved.</p>

<p>5. There are many hundred or thousand texts of
Scripture, which a man may possibly be ignorant of
the meaning of, and yet have a saving faith, and be
in a state of salvation. For no man living understandeth
it all.</p>

<p>6. The holy Scripture is an entire, comely body,
which containeth not only the essential parts of the
true religion, but also the integral parts, and the
ornaments and many accidents; which must be distinguished,
and not all taken to be equal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_388" id="Ref_388" href="#Foot_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>7. So much as containeth the essentials of true
religion, must be understood and believed of necessity
to salvation; and so much as containeth the integrals
of religion doth greatly conduce to our salvation,
both that we may be the surer and the better
christians, as having greater helps to both.</p>

<p>The very adjuncts also have their use to make us
the more adorned christians, and to promote our
knowledge of greater things.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXVIII. <i>How may we know the fundamentals, essentials, or
what parts are necessary to salvation? And is the papists' way
allowable that (some of them) deny that distinction, and make the
difference to be only in the degrees of men's opportunities of
knowledge?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Those papists' perverseness can mean
no better than that Christianity itself is not necessary
to salvation, to those that have not opportunity to
know it (as Johnson's Rejoinder to me, and Sancta
Clara, and many others, plainly intimate); and were
that never so true and certain, it were nothing to the
question between them and us, which is, What are
the essentials of christianity? And what is necessary
to salvation, where christianity is necessary? or
where the christian religion is made known, and men
may come to the knowledge of it, if they will do
their best? This is the true state of our controversy
with them. And whereas they would make all the
parts of christian faith and practice equally necessary,
where men have a capacity and ability to know, believe,
and practise them, it is a gross deceit, unworthy
of men pretending to a mediocrity of knowledge
in the nature of religion; and thereby they make all
sins and errors as equal as all duties and truths.
Whereas, 1. There is no man that hath not some
error and some sin.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_389" id="Ref_389" href="#Foot_389">[389]</a></span>
2. There is no man that doth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">{713}</a></span>
all that ever he was able to do, to understand all the
truth. 3. Therefore there is no man whose errors
themselves are not (many of them at least) culpable
or sinful. 4. And they that distinguish between mortal
and venial sins, and yet will not distinguish between
mortal and venial errors, are either blind, or would keep
others blind. As it is not so damning a sin for a man
to think a vain thought, or to speak a vain word, as
not to love God, or holiness; (no, though he was
more able to have forborne that idle word, than to
have loved God;) so it is not so mortal a sin, (that is,
inconsistent with a justified state,) to mistake in a
small matter, (as who was the father of Arphaxad,
or what year the world was drowned in, &amp;c.) as to
blaspheme the Holy Ghost, or deny Jesus Christ to
be the Saviour of the world, or to deny that there is
a God, or everlasting life, or a difference between
good and evil. All sins are not equal in magnitude
or danger. Therefore all errors are not equal in
magnitude, sinfulness, or danger.</p>

<p>2. And what priest is able to know whom to take
for a christian, and baptizable upon such terms as
these? Who knoweth just what opportunities of
knowledge other men have had, and what impediments?
And will they indeed baptize a man that is
a heathen, because he had not opportunity to come
to the knowledge of christianity? I think they will
not. Or will they deny baptism to one that knoweth
and believeth only all the articles of the creed,
and the chief points of religion, because he knoweth
not as much more, as he had opportunity to know?
I think not. Do not these men perceive how they
condemn themselves? For do they not say themselves,
that baptism to the due receiver washeth
away sin, and puts the person in a state of life? O
when will God deliver his poor church from factious
deceivers?</p>

<p>3. Either christianity is something and discernible,
or nothing and undiscernible. If the latter, then
christians are not to be distinguished from heathens
and infidels. If the former, then christianity hath
its constitutive parts, by which it is what it is. And
then it hath essential parts distinguishable from the
rest.</p>

<p>4. The word fundamentals being but a metaphor,
hath given room to deceivers and contenders to make
a controversy, and raise a dust about it. Therefore
I purposely use the word essentials, which is not so
liable to men's cavils.</p>

<p>5. Those are the essentials of christianity, which
are necessary to the baptism of the adult. Know but
that, and you answer all the pratings of the papists,
that bawl out for a list of fundamentals. And sure
it is not this day unknown in the christian world,
either what a christian is, or who is to be baptized:
do not the priests know it, who baptize all that are
christened in the world? And why is baptism called
our christening, if it make us not christians? And
why hath Christ promised, that "he that believeth
and is baptized, shall be saved," Mark xvi. 16, if
that so much faith as is necessary to baptism, will
not also serve to a man's state of salvation?</p>

<p>6. The baptismal covenant of grace therefore is
the essential part of the gospel, and of the christian
religion; and all the rest are the integrals, and accidents
or adjuncts.</p>

<p>7. This covenant containeth,</p>

<p>I. Objectively, 1. Things true as such; 2. Things
good as such; 3. Things practicable or to be done,
as such: the <i>credenda, diligenda, (et eligenda,) et
agenda</i>; as the objects of man's intellect, will, and
practical power.</p>

<p>The <i>credenda</i>, or things to be known and believed,
are, 1. God as God, and our God and Father. 2.
Christ as the Saviour, and our Saviour. 3. The
Holy Ghost as such, and as the Sanctifier, and our
Sanctifier (as to the offer of these relations in the
covenant).</p>

<p>The <i>diligenda</i> are the same three Persons in these
three relations as good in themselves and unto us,
which includeth the grand benefits of reconciliation
and adoption, justification, and sanctification, and
salvation.</p>

<p>The <i>agenda</i> in the time of baptism that make us
christians, are, 1. The actual dedition, resignation, or
dedication of ourselves, to God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost in these relations. 2. A promise or vow
to endeavour faithfully to live according to our undertaken
relations (though not in perfection); that
is, as creatures to their Creator, and their reconciled
God and Father; as christians to their Redeemer,
their Teacher, their Ruler, and their Saviour; and
as willing receivers of the sanctifying and comforting
operations of the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>II. The objects tell you what the acts must be on
our part; 1. With the understanding, to know and
believe; 2. With the will to love, choose, desire, and
resolve; and, 3. Practically to deliver up ourselves
for the present, and to promise for the time to come.
These are the essentials of the christian religion.</p>

<p>8. The creed is a larger explication of the <i>credenda</i>,
and the Lord's prayer of the <i>diligenda</i>, or things to
be willed, desired, and hoped for; and the decalogue
of the natural part of the <i>agenda</i>.</p>

<p>9. Suffer not your own ignorance, or the papists'
cheats, to confound the question about fundamentals,
as to the matter, and as to the expressing words. It
is one thing to ask, What is the matter essential to
christianity? And another, What words, symbols,
or sentences are essential to it? To the first, I have
now answered you. To the second I say, 1. Taking
the christian religion as it is, an extrinsic doctrine
<i>in signis</i>, so the essence of it is, words and signs expressive
or significant of the material essence. That
they be such in specie is all that is essential. And
if they say, But which be those words? I answer,
2. That no particular words in the world are essential
to the christian religion. For, (1.) No one
language is essential to it. It is not necessary to
salvation that you be baptized, or learn the creed or
Scriptures, in Hebrew, or Greek, or Latin, or English,
so you learn it in any language understood. (2.) It
is not necessary to salvation that you use the same
words in the same language, as long as it hath more
words than one to express the same thing by. (3.)
It is not necessary to salvation, that we use the same
(or any one single) form, method, or order of words,
as they are in the creeds, without alteration. And
therefore while the ancients did tenaciously cleave
to the same symbol or creed, yet they used various
words to express it by. (As may be seen in Irenæus,
Tertullian, Origen, and Ruffin, elsewhere cited
by me; so that it is plain, that by the same symbol
they meant the same matter, though expressed in
some variety of words.) Though they avoided such
variety as might introduce variety of sense and
matter.</p>

<p>10. Words being needful, 1. To make a learner
understand; 2. To tell another what he understandeth:
it followeth that the great variety of men's
capacities maketh a great variation in the necessity
of words or forms. An Englishman must have
them in English, and a Frenchman in French. An
understanding man may receive all the essentials in
a few words; but an ignorant man must have many
words to make him understand the matter. To him
that understandeth them, the words of the baptismal
covenant express all the essentials of christianity:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">{714}</a></span>
but to him that understands them not, the creed is
necessary for the explication: and to him that understandeth
not that, a catechism, or larger exposition,
is necessary. This is the plain explication of
this question, which many papists seem loth to
understand.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXXXIX. <i>What is the use and authority of the creed? And is
it of the apostles' framing or not? And is it the word of God or
not?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The use of the creed is, to be a plain
explication of the faith professed in the baptismal
covenant. 1. For the fuller instruction of the duller
sort, and those that had not preparatory knowledge,
and could not sufficiently understand the meaning of
the three articles of the covenant, what it is to believe
in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, without
more words. 2. And for the satisfaction of the
church, that indeed men understood what they did in
baptism, and professed to believe.</p>

<p>2. The creed is the word of God, as to all the doctrine
or matter of it, whatever it be as to the order
and composition of words.</p>

<p>3. That is oft by the ancients called the apostles',
which containeth the matter delivered by the apostles,
though not in a form of words compiled by them.</p>

<p>4. It is certain that all the words now in our creed,
were not put in by the apostles, 1. Because some of
them were not in till long after their days. 2. Because
the ancient <i>formulæ</i> agree not in words among
themselves.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_390" id="Ref_390" href="#Foot_390">[390]</a></span></p>

<p>5. It is not to be doubted of, but the apostles did
appoint and use a creed commonly in their days.
And that it is the same with that which is now called
the apostles' and the Nicene in the main; but not
just the same composure of words, nor had they any
such precise composure as can be proved. But this
much is easily provable:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1.) That Christ composed a creed when he made
his covenant, and instituted baptism, Matt, xxviii. 19.</p>

<p>(2.) That in the Jewish church, where men were
educated in the knowledge of the Scriptures, and expectation
of the Messiah, it was supposed that the
people had so much preparatory knowledge, as made
them the more capable of baptism, as soon as they
did but seriously profess to believe, and consent to
the terms of the covenant; and therefore they were
presently baptized, Acts ii. 38-40.</p>

<p>(3.) That this could not be rationally supposed
among the gentiles, and common, ignorant people
of the world. And <i>ignorantis non est consensus</i>. He
doth not covenant who understandeth not the covenant,
as to what is promised him, and what he promiseth.</p>

<p>(4.) That the apostles baptized, and caused others
to baptize many thousands, and settle many churches,
before any part of the New Testament was written,
even many and many years.</p>

<p>(5.) That the apostles did their work as well and
better than any that succeeded them.</p>

<p>(6.) That their successors in the common ministry,
did, as far as any church history leadeth us up, instruct
and catechise men in the meaning of the
baptismal covenant, (which is the christian faith,)
before they baptized them: yea, they kept them
long in the state of catechumens usually, before they
would baptize them. And after baptized but twice
a year, at Easter and Whitsuntide (as our liturgy
noteth). And they received an account of their
tolerable understanding of religion, before they would
receive them into the church.</p>

<p>(7.) No doubt then but the apostles did cause the
baptizable to understand the three articles of Christ's
own creed and covenant, and to give some account
of it before they baptized them, ordinarily among
the gentiles.</p>

<p>(8.) No doubt therefore but they used many more
explicatory words, to cause them to understand those
few.</p>

<p>(9.) There is neither proof nor probability, that
they used a composure of just the same words, and
no more or less: because they had to do with persons
of several capacities, some knowing, who needed fewer
words, and some ignorant and dull, who needed more:
nor is any such composure come down to our hands.</p>

<p>(10.) But it is more than probable, that the matter
opened by them to all the catechumens was still the
same, when the words were not the same. For
God's promises and man's conditions are still the
same (where the gospel cometh). Though since by
the occasion of heresies, some few material clauses
are inserted. For all christians had one christianity,
and must go one way to heaven.</p>

<p>(11.) It is also more than probable, that they did
not needlessly vary the words, lest it should teach
men to vary the matter: but that all christians before
baptism, did make the same profession of faith as
the sense, and very much the same as to the very
words; using necessary caution, and yet avoiding
unnecessary preciseness of formality; but so as to obviate
damnable heresies, that the christian profession
might attain its ends.</p>

<p>(12.) Lastly, no doubt but this practice of the
apostles was exemplary, and imitated by the churches,
and that thus the essentials of religion were, by the
tradition of the creed and baptism, delivered by
themselves, as far as christianity went, long before
any book of the New Testament was written: and
every christian was an impress, or transcript, or
specimen of it.<span

And that the following churches
using the same creed, (wholly in sense, and mostly
in words,) might so far well call it the apostles'
creed; as they did both the Western and the Nicene.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXL. <i>What is the use of catechisms?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> To be a more familiar explication of the
essentials of christianity, and the principal integrals,
in a larger manner than the creed, Lord's prayer,
and decalogue do; that the ignorant may the more
easily understand it. Every man cannot gather out
of the Scripture the greatest matters in the true
method, as distinct from all the rest: and therefore
it is part of the work of the church's teachers, to do
it to the hands and use of the ignorant.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLI. <i>Could any of us have known by the Scriptures alone the
essentials of religion from the rest, if tradition had not given them
to us in the creed, as from apostolical collection?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Yes: for the Scripture itself telleth us
what is necessary to salvation; it describeth to us
the covenant of grace, both promises and conditions;
and it were strange if so large a volume should not
as plainly tell us what is necessary to salvation, as
fewer words! The Scripture hath not less than the
creed, but more.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLII. <i>What is the best method of a true catechism or sum of
theology?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> God willing, I shall tell the church my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">{715}</a></span>
opinion of that at large, in a peculiar Latin treatise,
called "Methodus Theologiæ," which here I cannot
do. Only I shall say, that among all the great
variety of methods used in these times, I think none
cometh nearer the order of the matter, (which is the
true commendation of a method,) than those which
open theology, 1. In the breviate of the baptismal
covenant. 2. In the three explicatory sums, the creed,
Lord's prayer, and decalogue, with the added gospel
precepts. 3. In the largest form, which is the
whole Scripture. And that our common English
catechism, and Paræus or Ursine, and many such
who use that common easy method, are more truly
methodical, than most that pretend to greater accurateness
(though I much commend the great industry
of such as Dudley, Fenner, Gomarus, and
especially George Sohnius).</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLIII. <i>What is the use of various church confessions or
articles of faith?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I will pass by the very ill use that is made
of them in too many countries, where unnecessary
opinions or uncertain are put in, and they that can
get into favour with the secular power, take advantage
under pretence of orthodoxness and uniformity,
truth and peace, to set up their opinions and judgments
to be the common rule for all to bow to,
though wiser than themselves: and to silence all
ministers, and scatter and divide the flocks that will
not say or swear as they do, that is, that they are
wise men, and are in the right.</p>

<p>The true and commendable use of various church
professions, or confessions of faith, is, 1. To be an
instruction to the more ignorant how to understand
the Scriptures in most of the most weighty points.
2. To be an enumeration of those doctrines, against
which no minister shall be allowed to preach, and
according to which he is to instruct the people.
3. To be a testimony to all neighbour or foreign
churches in a heterodox, contentious, and suspicious
age, how we understand the Scriptures, for the confuting
of scandals and unjust suspicions, and the
maintaining communion in faith, and charity, and
doctrine.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLIV. <i>May not the subscribing of the whole Scriptures serve
turn for all the aforesaid ends without creeds, catechisms, or
confessions?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. By subscribing to the Scriptures you
mean either, generally and implicitly, that all in
them is true and good (though perhaps you know
not what is in it). Or else particularly and explicitly,
that every point in it is by you both understood
and believed to be true.</p>

<p>In the first sense, it is not sufficient to salvation:
for this implicit faith hath really no act in it, but a
belief that all that God saith is true; which is only
the formal object of faith, and is no more than to
believe that there is a God (for a liar is not a God).
And this he may do, who never believed in Christ,
or a word of Scripture, as not taking it to be God's
word; yea, that will not believe that God forbiddeth
his beastly life. Infidels ordinarily go thus far.</p>

<p>In the second sense, (of an explicit, or particular
actual belief,) the belief of the whole Scripture is
enough indeed, and more than any man living can
attain to. No man understandeth all the Scripture.
Therefore that which no man hath, is to be exacted
of all men, or any man, in order to ministration or
communion. While, 1. No man can subscribe to
any one translation of the Bible, that it is not faulty,
being the work of defectible man. 2. And few have
such acquaintance with the Hebrew, and Chaldee,
and Greek, as to be able to say that they understand
the original languages perfectly. 3. And no man
that understands the words, doth perfectly understand
the matter. It followeth that no man is to be
forced or urged to subscribe to all things in the
Scriptures, as particularly understood by him, with an
explicit faith. And an implicit is not half enough.</p>

<p>2. The true mean therefore is the ancient way,
1. To select the essentials for all christians, to be
believed particularly and explicitly. 2. To collect
certain of the most needful integrals, which teachers
shall not preach against. 3. And for all men
moreover to profess in general that they implicitly
believe all which they can discern to be the holy
canonical Scripture, and that all is true which is
the word of God; forbearing each other even about
the number of canonical books and texts.</p>

<p>And it is the great wisdom and mercy of God,
which hath so ordered it, that the Scripture shall
have enough to exercise the strongest, and yet that
the weakest may be ignorant of the meaning of a
thousand sentences, without danger of damnation, so
they do but understand the marrow or essentials, and
labour faithfully to increase in the knowledge of the
rest.<span

<h3>Quest. CXLV. <i>May not a man be saved that believeth all the
essentials of religion, as coming to him by verbal tradition, and not
as contained in the holy Scriptures, which perhaps he never knew?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. He that believeth shall be saved, which
way ever he cometh by his belief; so be it it be
sound as to the object and act; that is, if it contain
all the essentials, and they be predominantly believed,
loved, and practised.</p>

<p>2. The Scriptures being the records of Christ's
doctrine delivered by himself, his Spirit, and his
apostles, it is the office of ministers, and the duty of
all instructors, to open these Scriptures to those they
teach, and to deliver particulars upon the authority
of these inspired, sealed records which contain them.</p>

<p>3. They that thus receive particular truths, from
a teacher explaining the Scripture to them, do receive
them in a subordination to the Scripture, materially,
and as to the teacher's part; though not formally,
and as to their own part; and though the
Scripture authority being not understood by them,
be not the formal object of their faith, but only
God's authority in general.</p>

<p>4. They that are ignorant of the being of the
Scripture, have a great disadvantage to their faith.</p>

<p>5. Yet we cannot say, but it may be the case of
thousands to be saved by the gospel delivered by
tradition, without resolving their faith into the
authority of the Scriptures. For,</p>

<p>1. This was the case of all the christians (as to the
New Testament) who lived before it was written;
and there are several articles of the creed now necessary,
which the Old Testament doth not reveal.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_394" id="Ref_394" href="#Foot_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>2. This may be the case of thousands in ignorant
countries, where the Bible being rare, is to most
unknown.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_395" id="Ref_395" href="#Foot_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>3. This may be the case of thousands of children
who are taught their creed and catechism, before
they understand what the Bible is.</p>

<p>4. This may be the case of thousands among the
papists, where some perverse priests do keep not
only the reading, but the knowledge of the Scriptures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">{716}</a></span>
from the people, for fear lest they should be
taught to resolve their faith into it; and do teach
them only the articles of faith and catechism, as
known by the church's tradition alone.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLVI. <i>Is the Scripture fit for all christians to read,
being so obscure?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The essentials and points necessary to
salvation are plain.</p>

<p>2. We are frequently and vehemently commanded
to delight in it, and meditate in it day and night; to
search it; to teach it our very children, speaking of
it at home and abroad, lying down and rising up,
and to write it on the posts of our houses, and on
our doors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. It is suited to the necessity and understanding
of the meanest, to give light to the simple, and to
make the very foolish wise.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_396" id="Ref_396" href="#Foot_396">[396]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The ancient fathers and christians were all of
this mind.</p>

<p>5. All the christian churches of the world have
been used to read it openly to all, even to the simplest;
and if they may hear it, they may read the
same words which they hear.</p>

<p>6. God blessed the ignorant Ethiopian eunuch
when he found him reading the Scriptures, though
he knew not the sense of what he read, and sent him
Philip to instruct him and convert him.</p>

<p>7. Timothy was educated in the knowledge of the
Scriptures in his childhood.</p>

<p>8. That which is written to and for all men, may
be read by all that can; but the Scripture was written
to and for all,<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_397" id="Ref_397"
href="#Foot_397">[397]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;&amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But there are many things in it hard to be
understood.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. And there are many things easy to be
understood. 2. We never said that men should not
use the help of their teachers, and all that they can
to understand it. 3. Were not those teachers once
ignorant? And yet they did read it by the help of
teachers; and so may others. 4. As the king for
concord commandeth all the schoolmasters to teach
one grammar; so God maketh it the minister's office
to instruct people in the Scriptures. And were
it not a question unworthy of a schoolmaster, to
dispute, Whether the scholars must learn by their
book, or by their master? Yea, to conclude that it
must be by their master, and not by their book: or that
they must never open their book, but when their master
is just at hand to teach them. The doctrine of the
papists, who tell us that the Scriptures should not be
read by the vulgar, it being the rise of all heresies, is
so inhuman and impious, as savouring of gross enmity
to Scriptures, and to knowledge, that were there no
other, it would make the lovers of religion and men's
souls to pray earnestly to Christ to save his flocks
from such seducers, who so Jewishly use the key of
knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But many wrest the Scriptures to their own
destruction, and what heresy is not defended as by
their authority?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. And many thousands receive saving
knowledge and grace by them. The law of the Lord
is perfect, converting the soul. All Scripture is
profitable to instruction, &amp;c. to make the man of
God perfect. It is the incorruptible seed by which
we are born again, and the sincere milk, by which
we are nourished.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_398" id="Ref_398" href="#Foot_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>2. And is it not as true, 1. That the law of the
land is abused by every false pretender, lawyer, and
corrupt judge? What title so bad, that is not defended
in Westminster Hall sometimes, under pretence
of law? And what action so bad, that some
pretend not law for? What then? Must the law
be forbidden the common people for this?</p>

<p>2. Nay, what is so much abused to unrighteousness
and sin as reason itself? What heresy or crime
do not men plead reason for? Must reason therefore
be forbidden the vulgar?</p>

<p>3. Yea, contrarily, this signifieth that law and
reason are so far from being things to be forbidden
men, that they are indeed those things by which
nature and necessity have taught all the world to
try and discern right from wrong, good from bad;
otherwise good and bad men would not all thus
agree in pretending to them, and appealing to their
decisions.</p>

<p>4. If many men are poisoned or killed in eating
or drinking, if many men's eye-sight is abused to
mislead them unto sin, &amp;c. the way is not, to eat
nothing but what is put into our mouths; nor to put
out our eyes, or wink, and be led only by a priest;
but to use both the more cautiously, with the best
advice and help that we can get.</p>

<p>5. And do not these deceivers see, that their reason
pleadeth as strongly that priests and prelates
themselves should never read the Scripture (and
consequently that it should be banished out of the
world)? For who that is awake in the world can
be ignorant, that it is priests and prelates, who have
been the leaders of almost all heresies and sects;
who differ in their expositions and opinions, and lead
the vulgar into all the heresies which they fall into?
Who then should be forbidden to read the Scripture,
but priests and prelates, who wrest them to their
own and other men's destruction?</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLVII. <i>How far is tradition and men's words and ministry to
be used or trusted in, in the exercise of faith?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The churches and ministers received the
gospel in Scripture from the apostles, and the creed
as the summary of faith: and they delivered it down
to others, and they to us.</p>

<p>2. The ministers by office are the instructors of
the people in the meaning of it; and the keepers
of the Scriptures, as lawyers are of the laws of the
land.<span

<h3>Quest. CXLVIII. <i>How know we the true canon of Scripture from
apocrypha?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> By these means set together: 1. There is,
for the most part, a special venerable excellency in
the books themselves, which helpeth us in the distinct
reception of them.</p>

<p>2. The tradition of infallible church history telleth
us, which books they are which were written by
men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and who sealed
their doctrine with miracles in those times; it being
but matter of fact, (which books such men wrote
whom God bare witness to,) infallible church history
(such as we have to know which are the statutes
of the land, and which are counterfeit) is a sufficient
notification and proof.</p>

<p>3. The sanctifying Spirit still in all ages and
christians, attested the divinity and truth of the doctrine
of the main body of the Bible, especially the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">{717}</a></span>
gospel; and then if we should err about the authority
of a particular book, it would not overthrow our
faith. It is not necessary to salvation to believe
this particular text to be divine, but it is sin and
folly to doubt causelessly of the parts, when the
Spirit attesteth the doctrine and the body of the
book. I pass these things briefly, because I have
largelier handled them elsewhere.</p>

<h3>Quest. CXLIX. <i>Is the public reading of the Scripture the proper
work of a minister? or may a layman ordinarily do it? or another
officer?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> In such cases as I before showed that a
layman may preach, he may also read the Scriptures.
Of which look back.</p>

<p>2. No doubt but it is a work well beseeming the
ordained ministers or pastors, and an integral part
of their office; and should not be put off by them
when they can do it.</p>

<p>3. When they need help the deacons are ordained
ministers, authorized to help them in such work,
and fittest to do it.</p>

<p>4. Whether in a case of necessity a layman may
not ordinarily read the Scripture to the congregation,
is a case that I am loth to determine, being loth to
suppose such a necessity. But if the minister cannot,
and there be no deacon, I cannot prove it unlawful
for a layman to do it under the direction of
the pastor. I lived some time under an old minister
of about eighty years of age, (who never preached
himself,) whose eye-sight failing him, and having
not maintenance to keep an assistant, he did by
memory say the Common-prayer himself, and got a
tailor one year, and a thresher or poor day-labourer
another year, to read all the Scriptures. Whether
that were not better than nothing, I leave to consideration.</p>

<p>And I think it is commonly agreed on, that where
there is no minister, it is better for the people to
meet and hear a layman read the Scriptures and
some good books, than to have no public helps and
worship.</p>

<h3>Quest. CL. <i>Is it lawful to read the apocrypha, or any good books
besides the Scriptures, to the church? As homilies, &amp;c.?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is not lawful to read them as God's
word, or to pretend them to be the holy Scriptures,
for that is a falsehood, and an addition to God's word.</p>

<p>2. It is not lawful to read them scandalously, in a
title and manner tending to draw the people to believe
that they are God's word, or without a sufficient
distinguishing of them from the holy Scriptures.</p>

<p>3. If any one of the apocryphal books, (as Judith,
Tobit, Bel and the Dragon, &amp;c.) be as fabulous,
false, and bad as our protestant writers (Reignoldus,
Amesius, Whitakers, Chamier, and abundance more)
affirm them to be, it is not lawful ordinarily to read
them, in that honourable way as chapters called
lessons are usually read in the assemblies. Nor is
it lawful so to read heretical, fabulous, or erroneous
books.</p>

<p>But it is lawful to read publicly, apocryphal and
human writings, homilies, or edifying sermons, on
these conditions following.</p>

<p>1. So be it they be indeed sound doctrine, holy,
and fitted to the people's edification.</p>

<p>2. So be it they be not read scandalously without
sufficient differencing them from God's book.</p>

<p>3. So they be not read to exclude or hinder the
reading of the Scriptures, or any other necessary
church duty.</p>

<p>4. So they be not read to keep up an ignorant,
lazy ministry that can or will do no better; nor to
exercise the minister's sloth, and hinder him from
preaching.</p>

<p>5. And especially if authority command it, and
the church's agreement require it, as a signification
what doctrine it is which they profess.</p>

<p>6. Or if the church's necessities require it; as if
they have no minister, or no one that can do so
much to their edification any other way.</p>

<p>7. Therefore the use of catechisms is confessed
lawful in the church, by almost all.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLI. <i>May church assemblies be held where there is no
minister? Or what public worship may be so performed by laymen? (As
among infidels, or papists, where persecution hath killed, imprisoned,
or expelled the ministers.)</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Such an assembly as hath no pastor, or
minister of Christ, is not a church, in a political
sense, as the word signifieth a society consisting of
pastor and flock; but it may be a church in a larger
sense, as the word signifieth only a community or
association of private christians for mutual help in
holy things.</p>

<p>2. Such an assembly ought on the Lord's days,
and at other fit times, to meet together for mutual
help, and the public worshipping of God, as they
may, rather than not to meet at all.</p>

<p>3. In those meetings they may do all that followeth.
1. They may pray together; a layman being
the speaker. 2. They may sing psalms. 3. They
may read the Scriptures. 4. They may read some
holy, edifying writings of divines, or repeat some
minister's sermons. 5. Some that are ablest may
speak to the instruction and exhortation of the rest,
as a master may do in his family, or neighbours to
stir up God's graces in each other, as was opened
before. 6. And some such may catechise the younger
and more ignorant. 7. They may by mutual conference
open their cases to each other, and communicate
what knowledge or experience they have,
to the praise of God and each other's edification.
8. They may make a solemn profession of their faith,
covenant, and subjection to God the Father, Son,
and Holy Ghost; and all this is better than nothing
at all.</p>

<p>But, 1. None of them may do any of this as a
pastor, ruler, priest, or office teacher of the church.
2. Nor may they baptize. 3. Nor administer the
Lord's supper. 4. Nor excommunicate by sentence
(but only executively agree to avoid the notoriously
impenitent). 5. Nor absolve ministerially, or as by
authority; nor exercise any of the power of the
keys, that is, of government. 6. And they must do
their best to get a pastor as soon as they are able.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLII. <i>Is it lawful to subscribe or profess full assent and
consent to any religious books besides the Scripture, seeing all are
fallible?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is not lawful to profess or subscribe
that any book is truer or better than it is; or
that there is no fault in any that is faulty; or to
profess that we believe any mortal man to be totally
infallible in all that he shall write or say, or impeccable
in all that he shall do.</p>

<p>2. Because all men are fallible, and so are we in
judging, it is not lawful to say of any large and dubious
books, in which we know no fault, that there is
no fault or error in them: we being uncertain, and
it being usual for the best men even in their best
writings, prayers, or works to be faulty, as the consequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718">{718}</a></span>
or effect of our common culpable imperfection.
But we may say, that we know no fault or
error in it, if indeed we do not know of any.</p>

<p>3. It is lawful to profess or subscribe our assent
and consent to any human writing which we judge
to be true and good, according to the measure of its
truth and goodness; as if church confessions that
are sound be offered us for our consent, we may say
or subscribe, I hold all the doctrine in this book to
be true and good. And by so doing I do not assert
the infallibility of the authors, but only the verity of
the writing. I do not say that he cannot err, or that
he never erreth; but that he erreth not in this, as
far as I am able to discern.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLIII. <i>May we lawfully swear obedience in all things lawful
and honest, either to usurpers, or to our lawful pastors?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. If the question were of imposing such
oaths, I would say, that it was many a hundred years
before the churches of Christ (either under persecution,
or in their prosperity and glory) did ever know
of any such practice, as the people or the presbyters
swearing obedience to the bishops. And when it
came up, the magistracy, princes, and emperors fell
under the feet of the pope; and the clergy grew to
what we see it in the Roman kingdom, called a
church. And far should I be from desiring such
oaths to be imposed.</p>

<p>2. But the question being only of the taking such
oaths, and not the imposing of them, I say, that, (1.)
It is not lawful to swear obedience to a usurper,
civil or ecclesiastical, <i>in licitis et honestis</i>; because
it is a subjecting ourselves to him, and an acknowledging
that authority which he hath not; for we
can swear no further to obey the king himself but in
things lawful and honest; and to do so by a usurper
is an injury to the king, and unto Christ.</p>

<p>(2.) But if the king himself shall command us to
swear obedience to a subordinate civil usurper, he
thereby ceaseth to be a usurper, and receiveth authority,
and it becometh our duty. And if he that
was an ecclesiastical usurper, <i>quoad personam</i>, that
had no true call to a lawful office, shall after have a
call, or if any thing fall out, which shall make it our
duty to consent and call him, then the impediment
from his usurpation is removed.</p>

<p>(3.) It is not lawful, though the civil magistrate
command us to swear obedience even <i>in licitis et
honestis</i>, to such a usurper, whose office itself is unlawful,
or forbidden by Christ, as he is such an officer.
No protestant thinketh it lawful to swear obedience
to the pope as pope; nor do any that take lay-elders
to be an unlawful office, think it lawful to swear
obedience to them as such.</p>

<p>(4.) If one that is in an unlawful ecclesiastical
office, be also at once in another that is lawful, we
may swear obedience to him in respect of the lawful
office. So it is lawful to swear obedience to the
pope in Italy, as a temporal prince in his own dominions;
and to a cardinal, (as Richelieu, Mazarine,
Ximenes, &amp;c.) as the king's ministers, exercising a
power derived from him: so it is lawful for a tenant,
where law and custom requireth it, to swear fidelity
to a lay-elder, as his landlord or temporal lord and
master. And so the old nonconformists, who thought
the English prelacy an unlawful office, yet maintained
that it is lawful to take the oath of canonical
obedience, because they thought it was imposed by
the king and laws, and that we swear to them not as
officers claiming a divine right in the spiritual government,
but as ordinaries, or officers made by the
king to exercise so much of ecclesiastical jurisdiction
under him, as he can delegate; according to the
oath of supremacy, in which we all acknowledge the
king to be supreme in all ecclesiastical causes; that
is, not the supreme pastor, bishop, or spiritual key-bearer
or ruler, but the supreme civil ruler of the
church, who hath the power of the sword, and of
determining all things extrinsic to the pastoral
office; and so of the coercive government of all pastors
and churches, as well as of other subjects. And
if prelacy were proved never so unlawful, no doubt
but by the king's command we may swear or perform
formal obedience to a prelate, as he is the
king's officer. Of the nonconformists' judgment in
this, read Bradshaw against Canne, &amp;c.</p>

<p>(5.) But in such a case no oath to inferiors is lawful
without the consent of the sovereign power, or at
least against his will.</p>

<p>(6.) Though it be a duty for the flock to obey
every presbyter, yet if they would make all the
people swear obedience to them, all wise and conscionable
christians should dissent from the introduction
of such a custom, and deny such oaths as far
as lawfully they may: that is,</p>

<p>1. If the king be against it, we must refuse it.</p>

<p>2. If he be neutral or merely passive in it, we
must refuse, unless some apparent necessity for the
church's good require it.</p>

<p>1. Because it savoureth of pride in such presbyters.</p>

<p>2. Because it is a new custom in the church, and
contrary to the ancient practice.</p>

<p>3. It is not only without any authority given them
by Christ, that they exact such oaths, but also contrary
to the great humility, lowliness, and condescension,
in which he describeth his ministers, who
must be great, by being the servants of all.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_400" id="Ref_400" href="#Foot_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>4. And it tendeth to corrupt the clergy for the
future.</p>

<p>5. And such new impositions give just reason to
princes and to the people to suspect that the presbyters
are aspiring after some inordinate exaltation, or
have some ill project for the advancement of themselves.</p>

<p>(7.) But yet if it be not only their own ambition
which imposeth it, but either the king and laws
command it, or necessity require it for the avoidance
of a greater evil, it may be lawful and a duty to take
an oath of obedience to a lawful presbyter or bishop;
because, 1. It is a duty to obey them. 2. And it is
not forbidden us by Christ to promise or swear to do
our duty (even when they may sin in demanding
such an oath).</p>

<p>(8.) If an office be lawful in the essential parts,
and yet have unlawful integrals, or adjuncts, or be
abused in exercise, it will not by such additions or
abuses be made unlawful to swear obedience to the
officer as such.</p>

<p>(9.) If one presbyter or bishop would make another
presbyter or bishop to swear obedience to him
without authority, the case is the same as of the
usurpers before mentioned.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLIV. <i>Must all our preaching be upon a text of Scripture?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. In many cases it may be lawful to preach
without a text;<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_401" id="Ref_401" href="#Foot_401">[401]</a></span>
to make sacred orations like Gregory
Nazianzen's, and homilies like Macarius's,
Ephrem Syrus's, and many other ancients, and like
our own church homilies.</p>

<p>2. But ordinarily it is the fittest way to preach
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">{719}</a></span>
upon a text of Scripture.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_402" id="Ref_402" href="#Foot_402">[402]</a></span>
1. Because it is our very
office to teach the people the Scripture. The prophets
brought a new word or message from God;
but the priests did but keep, interpret, and preach
the law already received: and we are not successors
of the inspired prophets, but as the priests were,
teachers of God's received word. And this practice
will help the people to understand our office. 2.
And it will preserve the due esteem and reverence
of the holy Scriptures, which the contrary practice
may diminish.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLV. <i>Is not the law of Moses abrogated, and the whole Old
Testament out of date, and therefore not to be read publicly and
preached on?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The covenant of innocency is ceased
<i>cessante subditorum capacitate</i>, as a covenant or
promise. And so are the positive laws proper to
Adam, in that state, and to many particular persons
since.</p>

<p>2. The covenant mixed of grace and works, proper
to the Jews, with all the Jewish law as such, was
never made to us, or to the rest of the world; and to
the Jews it is ceased by the coming and perfecter
laws and covenant of Christ.</p>

<p>3. The prophecies and types of Christ, and the
promises made to Adam, Abraham, and others, of his
coming in the flesh, are all fulfilled, and therefore
not useful to all the ends of their first making: and
the many prophecies of particular things and persons
past and gone are accomplished.</p>

<p>4. But the law of nature is still Christ's law; and
that law is much expounded to us in the Old Testament:
and if God once, for another use, did say, This
is the law of nature, the truth of these words as a
divine doctrine and exposition of the law of nature
is still the same.</p>

<p>5. The covenant of grace made with Adam and
Noah for all mankind, is still in force as to the great
benefits and main condition, that is, as to pardon
given by it to true penitent believers, with a right to
everlasting life, and as to the obligation to sincere
obedience for salvation: though not as to the yet
future coming of Christ in the flesh. And this law
of grace was never yet repealed any further than
Christ's coming did fulfil it and perfect it: therefore
to the rest of the world, who never can have the
gospel or perfecter testament, as christians have,
the former law of grace is yet in force. And that is
the law, conjoined with the law of nature, which
now the world without the church is under: under,
I say, as to the force of the law, and a former promulgation
made to Adam and Noah, and some common
intimations of it in merciful forbearances, pardons,
and benefits; though how many are under it
as to the knowledge, reception, belief, and obedience
of it, and consequently are saved by it, is
more than I or any man knoweth.</p>

<p>6. There are many prophecies of Christ and the
christian church in the Old Testament yet to be fulfilled,
and therefore are still God's word for us.</p>

<p>7. There are many precepts of God to the Jews
and to particular persons, given them on reasons
common to them with us; where parity of reason
will help thence to gather our own duty now.</p>

<p>8. There are many holy expressions, (as in the
Psalms,) which are fitted to persons in our condition,
and came from the Spirit of God; and therefore
as such are fit for us now.</p>

<p>9. Even the fulfilled promises, types, and prophecies,
are still God's words, that is, his word given
to their several proper uses: and though much of
their use be changed or ceased, so is not all: they
are yet useful to us, to confirm our faith, while we
see their accomplishment, and see how much God
still led his church to happiness in one and the
same way.</p>

<p>10. On all these accounts therefore we may still
read the Old Testament, and preach upon it in the
public churches.<span

<h3>Quest. CLVI. <i>Must we believe that Moses's law did ever bind other
nations; or that any other parts of the Scripture bound them, or
belong to them? or that the Jews were all God's visible church on
earth?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I conjoin these three questions for despatch.</p>

<p>I. 1. Some of the matter of Moses's law did bind
all nations; that is, the law of nature as such.</p>

<p>2. Those that had the knowledge of the Jewish
law, were bound collaterally to believe and obey all
the expositions of the law of nature in it, and all the
laws which were given upon reasons common to all
the world; (as about degrees of marriage, particular
rules of justice, &amp;c.) As if I heard God from heaven
tell another that standeth by me, Thou shalt not
marry thy father's widow; for it is abominable, I
ought to apply that to me, being his subject, which
is spoken to another on a common reason.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_404" id="Ref_404" href="#Foot_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>3. All those gentiles that would be proselytes,
and join with the Jews in their policy, and dwelt
among them, were bound to be observers of their
laws. But, 1. The law of nature as mosaical, did
not formally and directly bind other nations. 2.
Nor were they bound to the laws of their peculiar
policy, civil or ecclesiastical, which were positives.
The reason is, (1.) Because they were all one body
of political laws, given peculiarly to one political
body. Even the decalogue itself was to them a
political law. (2.) Because Moses was not authorized
or sent to be the mediator or deliverer of that
law to any nation but the Jews. And being never
in the enacting or promulgation sent or directed to
the rest of the world, it could not bind them.</p>

<p>II. As to the second question, Though the Scripture
as a writing bound not all the world, yet, 1. The
law of nature as such which is recorded in Scripture
did bind all. 2. The covenant of grace was made
with all mankind in Adam and Noah; and they
were bound to promulgate it by tradition to all their
offspring. And no doubt so they did; whether by
word, (as all did,) or by writing also, (as it is like
some did, as Enoch's prophecies were it is like
delivered, or else they had not in terms been preserved
till Jude's time). 3. And God himself as
aforesaid by actual providences, pardoning, and
benefits given to them that deserved hell, did in part
promulgate it himself. 4. The neighbour nations
might learn much by God's doctrine and dealing
with the Jews.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_405" id="Ref_405" href="#Foot_405">[405]</a></span></p>

<p>III. To the third question, I answer, 1. The Jews
were a people chosen by God out of all the nations
of the earth, to be a holy nation, and his peculiar
treasure, having a peculiar divine law and covenant,
and many great privileges, to which the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">{720}</a></span>
world were strangers; so that they were advanced
above all other kingdoms of the world, though not
in wealth, nor worldly power, nor largeness of dominion,
yet in a special dearness unto God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_406" id="Ref_406" href="#Foot_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But they were not the only people to whom
God made a covenant of grace in Adam and Noah, as
distinct from the law or covenant of innocency.</p>

<p>3. Nor were they the only people that professed
to worship the true God; neither was holiness and
salvation confined to them; but were found in other
nations. Therefore though we have but little notice
of the state of other kingdoms in their times, and
scarcely know what national churches (that is,
whole nations professing saving faith) there were,
yet we may conclude that there were other visible
churches besides the Jews. For, 1. No Scripture
denieth it; and charity then must hope the best.
2. The Scriptures of the Old Testament give us
small account of other countries, but of the Jews
alone, with some of their neighbours. 3. Shem was
alive in Abraham's days (yea, about 34 years after
Abraham's death, and within 12 years of Ishmael's
death, viz. till about An. Mundi 2158). And so
great and blessed a man as Shem, cannot be thought
to be less than a king, and to have a kingdom governed
according to his holiness; and so that there
was with him not only a church, but a national
church, or holy kingdom. 4. And Melchizedec was
a holy king and priest; and therefore had a kingdom
holily governed; and therefore not only a visible but
also a national church (supposing that he was not
Shem, as the Jews and Broughton, &amp;c. think; for
the situation of his country doth make many desert
that opinion). 5. And Job and his friends show that
there were churches then besides the Jews. 6. And
it is not to be thought that all Ishmael's posterity
suddenly apostatized. 7. Nor that Esau's posterity
had no church state (for both retained circumcision).
8. Nor is it like that Abraham's offspring
by Keturah were all apostates, being once inchurched.
For though the special promise was made to
Isaac's seed, as the peculiar holy nation, &amp;c. yet not
as the only children of God, or persons in a state of
salvation. 9. And the passages in Jonah about
Nineveh give us some such intimations also. 10.
And Japheth and his seed being under a special
blessing, it is not like that they all proved apostates.
And what was in all other kingdoms of the world is
little known to us.</p>

<p>We must therefore take heed of concluding, (as
the proud Jews were at last apt to do of themselves,)
that because they were a chosen nation privileged
above all others, that therefore the Redeemer under
the law of grace made to Adam, had no other
churches in the world, and that there were none
saved but the Jews and proselytes.<span

<h3>Quest. CLVII. <i>Must we think accordingly of the christian churches
now, that they are only advanced above the rest of the world as the
Jews were, but not the only people that are saved?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> This question being fitter for another
place, what hope there is of the salvation of the people
that are not christians, I have purposely handled
in another treatise, (in my "Method. Theologiæ,")
and shall only say now, 1. That those that receive
not Christ and the gospel revealed and offered to
them cannot be saved.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_408" id="Ref_408" href="#Foot_408">[408]</a></span>
2. That all those shall be
saved (if such there be) who never had sufficient
means to know Christ incarnate, and yet do faithfully
perform the common conditions of the covenant
of grace as it was made with Adam and Noah; and
particularly all that are truly sanctified, who truly
hate all known sin, and love God as God above all,
as their merciful, reconciled, pardoning Father, and
lay up all their hopes in heaven, in the everlasting
fruition of him in glory, and set their hearts there,
and for those hopes deny the interest of the flesh,
and all things of this world.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_409" id="Ref_409" href="#Foot_409">[409]</a></span></p>

<p>3. But how many or who doth this abroad in all
the kingdoms of the world, who have not the distinct
knowledge of the articles of the christian faith, it is
not possible for us to know.</p>

<p>4. But (as Aquinas and the schoolmen ordinarily
conclude this question) we are sure that the church
hath this prerogative above all others, that salvation
is incomparably more common to christians, than to
any others, as their light, and helps, and means are
more. The opinions of Justin, and Clem. Alexandr.
Origen, and many other ancients, of the heathens'
salvation, I suppose is known. In short:</p>

<p>1. It seems plain to me, that all the world that are
no christians, and have not the gospel, are not by
Christ's incarnation put into a worse condition than
they were in before; but may be saved on the
same terms that they might have been saved on
before.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_410" id="Ref_410" href="#Foot_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That Christ's apostles were in a state of salvation
before they believed the articles of Christ's dying
for sin, his resurrection, ascension, the giving of the
Holy Ghost, and Christ's coming to judgment, as
they are now to be believed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_411" id="Ref_411" href="#Foot_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>3. That all the faithful before Christ's coming
were saved by a more general faith than the apostles
had, as not being terminated in this person,
Jesus, as the Messiah, but only expected the Messiah
to come.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_412" id="Ref_412" href="#Foot_412">[412]</a></span></p>

<p>4. That as more articles are necessary to those
that have the gospel, than to those that have it not,
and to those since Christ's incarnation that hear of
him, than to the Jews before, so before, there were
more things necessary even to those Jews, (that had
a shorter creed than that which the apostles believed
before the resurrection,) than was to the rest of the
world that had not promises, prophecies, types, and
laws, so particular, distinct, and full as they had.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_413" id="Ref_413" href="#Foot_413">[413]</a></span></p>

<p>5. That the promises, covenant, or law of grace,
was made to all lapsed mankind in Adam and Noah.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_414" id="Ref_414" href="#Foot_414">[414]</a></span></p>

<p>6. That this law or covenant is still of the same
tenor, and not repealed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_415" id="Ref_415" href="#Foot_415">[415]</a></span></p>

<p>7. That this covenant giveth pardoning mercy,
and salvation, and promiseth victory over Satan, to
and by the holy seed.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_416" id="Ref_416" href="#Foot_416">[416]</a></span></p>

<p>8. That the condition on man's part, is repentance,
and faith in God as a merciful God, thus pardoning
sin, and saving the penitent believer. But just how
particular or distinct their belief of the incarnation
of Christ was to be, is hard to determine.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_417" id="Ref_417" href="#Foot_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>9. But after Christ's incarnation, even they that
know it not, yet are not by the first covenant bound
to believe that the Messiah is yet to be incarnate, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">{721}</a></span>
the word made flesh; for they are not bound to
believe an untruth, and that as the condition of salvation.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_418" id="Ref_418" href="#Foot_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Men were saved by Christ about four thousand
years before he was man, and had suffered, satisfied,
or merited as man.</p>

<p>11. The whole course of God's actual providence
since the fall, hath so filled the world with mercies
contrary to man's demerit, that it is an actual universal
proclamation of the pardoning law of grace;
which is thereby now become even a law of nature,
that is, of lapsed, pardoned nature, as the first
was the natural law of innocence.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_419" id="Ref_419" href="#Foot_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>12. Christ giveth a great deal of mercy to them
that never heard of him or know him: and he giveth
far more mercy to believers, than they have a particular
knowledge and belief of.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_420" id="Ref_420" href="#Foot_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>13. There is no salvation but by Christ the Saviour
of the world; though there be more mercy from
Christ, than there is faith in Christ.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_421" id="Ref_421" href="#Foot_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>14. No man could ever be saved without believing
in God as a merciful, pardoning, saving God, though
many have been saved who knew not the person of
Christ, determinately. For he that cometh to God
must believe that God is, and that he is the rewarder
of them that diligently seek him; who is no respecter
of persons, but in every nation, he that
feareth God and worketh righteousness is accepted
of him.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_422" id="Ref_422" href="#Foot_422">[422]</a></span></p>

<p>15. All nations on earth that have not the gospel,
are obliged by God to the use of certain means, and
improvement of certain mercies, in order or tendency
to their salvation. And it is their sin if they use
them not.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_423" id="Ref_423" href="#Foot_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>16. God hath appointed no means in vain, which
men must either not use, or use despairingly. But
his command to use any means for any end, containeth
(though not an explicit promise, yet) great
and comfortable encouragement to use that means
in hope.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_424" id="Ref_424" href="#Foot_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>17. Therefore the world is now in comparison of
the catholic church, much like what it was before
Christ's incarnation in comparison of the Jews'
church; who yet had many ways great advantage,
though God was not the God of the Jews only, but
also of the gentiles, who had a law written in their
hearts, and an accusing or excusing conscience.</p>

<p>18. Those over-doing divines who pretend to be
certain that all the world are damned that are not
christians, do add to God's word, and are great
agents for Satan to tempt men to infidelity, and to
atheism itself, and to dissuade mankind from discerning
the infinite goodness of God; and occasion
many to deny the immortality of the soul, rather
than they will believe, that five parts in six of the
world now, and almost all before Christ's incarnation,
have immortal souls purposely created in them,
to be damned, without any propounded means and
possibility natural of remedy; and as I know they
will pour out their bitter censure on these lines,
(which I could avoid if I regarded it more than truth,)
so with what measure they mete, it shall be measured
to them; and others will damn them as confidently
as they damn almost all the world; and I will
be bold to censure that they are undoers of the church
by over-doing. See more in my "Vindication of
God's Goodness."</p>

<h3>Quest. CLVIII. <i>Should not christians take up with Scripture wisdom
only, without studying philosophy and other heathens' human
learning?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I have already proved the usefulness of
common knowledge called human learning, by twenty
reasons in my book called "The Unreasonableness
of Infidelity," part ii. sect. 23. p. 163, to which
I refer the reader; and only say now, 1. Grace presupposeth
nature; we are men in order of nature
at least before we are saints, and reason is before
supernatural revelation. 2. Common knowledge
therefore is subservient unto faith: we must know
the Creator and his works; and the Redeemer restoreth
us to the due knowledge of the Creator:
human learning in the sense in question is also
divine, God is the author of the light of nature, as
well as of grace. We have more than heathens, but
must not therefore have less, and cast away the good
that is common to them and us; else we must not
have souls, bodies, reason, health, time, meat, drink,
clothes, &amp;c. because heathens have them. God's
works are honourable, sought out of all them that
have pleasure therein; and physical philosophy is
nothing but the knowledge of God's works. 3. And
the knowledge of languages is necessary both for
human converse, and for the understanding the
Scriptures themselves. The Scriptures contain not
a Greek and Hebrew grammar to understand the
languages in which they are written, but suppose us
otherwise taught those tongues that we may interpret
them. 4. The use of the gospel is not to teach
us all things needful to be known; but to teach us,
on supposition of our common knowledge, how to
advance higher to supernatural saving knowledge,
faith, love, and practice. Scripture telleth us not
how to build a house, to plough, sow, weave, or
make our works of art. Every one that learneth his
country tongue of his parents hath human learning
of the same sort with the learning of Greek and
Hebrew; he that learneth not to read, cannot read
the Bible. And he that understandeth it not in the
original tongues, must trust other men's words that
have human learning, or else remain a stranger
to it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_425" id="Ref_425" href="#Foot_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>But though none but proud fools will deny the
need of that human learning which improveth nature,
and is subservient to our knowledge of supernatural
revelations, yet well doth Paul admonish us,
to take heed that none deceive us by vain philosophy;
and saith that the wisdom of the world is foolishness
with God, and that the knowledge of Christ
crucified is the true christian philosophy or wisdom.
For indeed the dark philosophers groping after the
knowledge of God, did frequently stumble, and did
introduce abundance of logical and physical vanities,
uncertainties, and falsities, under the name of
philosophy, by mere niceties and high pretendings,
seeking for the glory of wisdom to themselves;
whenas it is one thing to know God's works and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">{722}</a></span>
God in them, and another thing to compose a system
of physics and metaphysics containing abundance of
errors and confusion, and jumbling a few certainties
with a great many uncertainties and untruths, and
every sect pulling down what others asserted, and
all of them disproving the methods and assertions of
others, and none proving their own. And the truth
is, after all latter discoveries, there is yet so much
error, darkness, uncertainty, and confusion in the
philosophy of every pretending sect, (the Peripatetics,
the Stoics, the Pythagoreans and Platonists,
much more the Epicureans, the Lullianists, and Cartesians,
Telesius, Campanella, Patricius, Gassendus,
&amp;c.) that it is a wonder that any that ever thoroughly
tried them, can be so weak as to glory much of
the certainties and methods of any, which hitherto
are so palpably uncertain, and full of certain errors.
We may therefore make use of all true human learning,
real and organical (and he is the happy scholar
who fasteneth upon the certain and the useful parts
well distinguished from the rest, and truly useth
them to their great and proper ends): but niceties
and fooleries which some spend their lives in for
mere ostentation, and also uncertain presumptions,
should be much neglected; and the great, certain,
necessary, saving verities of morality and the gospel
must be dearly loved, and thankfully embraced,
and studiously learned, and faithfully practised, by
all that would prove wise men at last.<span

<h3>Quest. CLIX. <i>If we think that Scripture and the law of nature do in
any point contradict each other, which may be the standard by which
the other must be tried?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is certain that they never do contradict
each other. 2. The law of nature is either that which
is very clear by natural evidence, or that which is
dark, (as degrees of consanguinity unfit for marriage,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_427" id="Ref_427" href="#Foot_427">[427]</a></span>
the evil of officious lies, &amp;c.) 3. The Scriptures
also have their plain and their obscurer parts. 4. A
dark scripture is not to be expounded contrary to a
plain, natural verity. 5. A dark and doubtful point
in nature is not to be expounded contrary to a plain
and certain scripture. 6. To suppose that there be
an apparent contradiction in cases of equal clearness
or doubtfulness, is a case not to be supposed; but he
that should have such a dream, must do as he would
do if he thought two texts to be contradictory, that
is, he must better study both till he see his error;
still remembering that natural evidence hath this
advantage, that it is, 1. First in order; 2. And most
common and received by all; but supernatural evidence
hath this advantage, that it is for the most
part the more clear and satisfactory.<span

<h3>Quest. CLX. <i>May we not look that God should yet give us more
revelations of his will, than there are already made in Scripture?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> You must distinguish between, 1. New
laws or covenants to mankind, and new predictions
or informations of a particular person. 2. Between
what may possibly be, and what we may expect as
certain or probable. And so I conclude,</p>

<p>1. That it is certain that God will make no other
covenant, testament, or universal law, for the government
of mankind or the church, as a rule of duty and
of judgment. Because he hath oft told us, that this
covenant and law is perfect, and shall be in force as
our rule till the end of the world.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_429" id="Ref_429" href="#Foot_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Object.</i> So it was said of the law of Moses, that it
was to stand for ever, yea, of many ceremonies in it.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. It is in the original only, for ages and
ages; or to generations and generations, which we
translate for ever, when it signifieth but to many
generations. 2. It is no where said, of Moses's law
as such, that it should continue either till the end of
the world, or till the day of judgment, as it is said of
the gospel. And, 3. It is not said that he will add
no more to the former testament, but contrarily, that
he will make a new covenant with them, &amp;c. But
here in the gospel he peremptorily resolveth against
all innovations and additions.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_430" id="Ref_430" href="#Foot_430">[430]</a></span></p>

<p>2. It is certain that God will make no new scripture
or inspired word as an infallible, universal rule
for the exposition of the word already written. For,
1. This were an addition which he hath disclaimed;
and, 2. It would imply such an insufficiency in the
gospel to its ends (as being not intelligible) as is contrary
to its asserted perfection; and, 3. It would be
contrary to that established way for the understanding
of the Scripture, which God hath already settled and
appointed for us till the end.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_431" id="Ref_431" href="#Foot_431">[431]</a></span></p>

<p>3. It is certain that God will give all his servants
in their several measures, the help and illumination
of his Spirit, for the understanding and applying of
the gospel.</p>

<p>4. It is possible that God may make new revelations
to particular persons about their particular
duties, events, or matters of fact, in subordination to
the Scripture, either by inspiration, vision, or apparition,
or voice; for he hath not told us that he will
never do such a thing. As to tell them, what shall
befall them or others; or to say, Go to such a place,
or, Dwell in such a place, or, Do such a thing, which
is not contrary to the Scripture, nor co-ordinate, but
only a subordinate determination of some undetermined
case, or the circumstantiating of an action.</p>

<p>5. Though such revelation and prophecy be possible,
there is no certainty of it in general, nor any
probability of it to any one individual person, much
less a promise. And therefore to expect it, or pray
for it, is but a presumptuous tempting of God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_432" id="Ref_432" href="#Foot_432">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>6. And all sober christians should be the more
cautelous of being deceived by their own imaginations,
because certain experience telleth us, that most in
our age that have pretended to prophecy, or to inspirations,
or revelations, have been melancholy,
cracked-brained persons, near to madness, who have
proved to be deluded in the end; and that such
crazed persons are still prone to such imaginations.</p>

<p>7. Therefore also all sober christians must take heed
of rash believing every prophet or pretended spirit,
lest they be led away from the sacred rule, and before
they are aware, be lost in vain expectations and
conceits.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXI. <i>Is not a third rule of the Holy Ghost, or perfecter
kingdom of love, to be expected, as different from the reign of the
Creator and Redeemer?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The works <i>ad extra</i> and the reign of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">{723}</a></span>
Father, Word, and Spirit are undivided. But yet
some things are more eminently attributed to one
person in the Trinity, and some to another.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_433" id="Ref_433" href="#Foot_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>2. By the law and covenant of innocency, the
Creator eminently ruled omnipotently. And the Son
ruled eminently sapientially, initially under the
covenant of promise or grace from Adam till his incarnation
and the descent of the Holy Ghost, and
more fully and perfectly afterward by the Holy
Ghost. And the Holy Ghost ever since doth rule in
the saints as the Paraclete, Advocate, or Agent of
Christ, and Christ by him, eminently by holy love;
which is yet but initially: but the same Holy Ghost
by perfect love shall perfectly rule in glory for ever;
even as the Spirit of the Father and the Son. We
have already the initial kingdom of love by the Spirit,
and shall have the perfect kingdom in heaven; and
besides the initial and the perfect there is no other.
Nor is the perfect kingdom to be expected before
the day of judgment, or our removal unto heaven;
for our kingdom is not of this world. And they that
sell all and follow Christ, do make the exchange for
a reward in heaven; and they that suffer persecution
for his sake, must rejoice because their reward
in heaven is great: and they that relieve a prophet
or righteous man for the sake of Christ, and that
lose any thing for him, shall have indeed a hundredfold
(in value) in this life, but in the world to come
eternal life. We shall be taken up in the clouds to
meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be
with the Lord: and those are the words with which
we must comfort one another, and not Jewishly with
the hopes of an earthly kingdom. And yet "we
look for a new heaven and a new earth wherein
dwelleth righteousness, according to his promise."
But who shall be the inhabitants, and how that heaven
and earth shall differ, and what we shall then
have to do with earth, whether to be overseers of
that righteous earth (and so to judge or rule the
world) as the angels are now over us in this world,
are things which yet I understand not.<span

<h3>Quest. CLXII. <i>May we not look for miracles hereafter?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The answer to quest. clx. may serve to
this. 1. God may work miracles if he please, and
hath not told us that he never will.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_435" id="Ref_435" href="#Foot_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>2. But he hath not promised us that he will,
and therefore we cannot believe such a promise, nor
expect them as a certain thing. Nor may any pray
for the gift of miracles.</p>

<p>3. But if there be any probability of them, it will
be to those that are converting infidel nations, when
they may be partly of such use as they were at first.</p>

<p>4. Yet it is certain, that God still sometimes worketh
miracles; but arbitrarily and rarely, which may
not put any individual person in expectation of them.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> Is not the promise the same to us as to the
apostles and primitive christians, if we could but
believe as they did?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. The promise to be believed goeth before
the faith that believeth it, and not that faith before
the promise.</p>

<p>2. The promise of the Holy Ghost was for perpetuity,
to sanctify all believers: but the promise of
that special gift of miracles, was for a time, because
it was for a special use; that is, to be a standing seal
to the truth of the gospel, which all after-ages may
be convinced of in point of fact, and so may still
have the use and benefit of.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_436" id="Ref_436" href="#Foot_436">[436]</a></span>
And Providence (ceasing
miracles) thus expoundeth the promise. And
if miracles must be common to all persons and ages,
they would be as no miracles. And we have seen
those that most confidently believed they should
work them, all fail.</p>

<p>But I have written so largely of this point in a set
disputation in my Treatise called "The Unreasonableness
of Infidelity," fully proving those first miracles
satisfactory and obligatory to all following ages,
that I must thither now refer the reader.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXIII. <i>Is the Scripture to be tried by the Spirit, or the
Spirit by the Scripture, and which of them is to be preferred?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I put the question thus confusedly, for the
sake of those that use to do so, to show them how
to get out of their own confusion. You must distinguish,
1. Between the Spirit in itself considered,
and the Scripture in itself. 2. Between the several
operations of the Spirit. 3. Between the several
persons that have the Spirit. And so you must
conclude,</p>

<p>1. That the Spirit in itself is infinitely more excellent
than the Scripture. For the Spirit is God, and
the Scripture is but the work of God.</p>

<p>2. The operation of the Spirit in the apostles was
more excellent than the operation of the same Spirit
now in us; as producing more excellent effects, and
more infallible.</p>

<p>3. Therefore the holy Scriptures which were the
infallible dictates of the Spirit in the apostles, are
more perfect than any of our apprehensions which
come by the same Spirit (which we have not in so
great a measure).<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_437" id="Ref_437" href="#Foot_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Therefore we must not try the Scriptures by our
most spiritual apprehensions, but our apprehensions
by the Scriptures: that is, we must prefer the Spirit's
inspiring the apostles to indite the Scriptures, before
the Spirit's illuminating of us to understand them, or
before any present inspirations, the former being the
more perfect; because Christ gave the apostles the
Spirit to deliver us infallibly his own commands, and
to indite a rule for following ages; but he giveth us
the Spirit but to understand and use that rule aright.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_438" id="Ref_438" href="#Foot_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>5. This trying the Spirit by the Scriptures, is not
a setting of the Scripture above the Spirit itself;
but is only a trying the Spirit by the Spirit: that is,
the Spirit's operations in ourselves and his revelations
to any pretenders now, by the Spirit's operations
in the apostles, and by their revelations recorded
for our use. For they, and not we, are called
foundations of the church.<span

<h3>Quest. CLXIV. <i>How is a pretended prophet, or revelation, to be
tried?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. If it be contrary to the Scripture it is to
be rejected as a deceit.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_440" id="Ref_440" href="#Foot_440">[440]</a></span></p>

<p>2. If it be the same thing which is in the Scripture,
we have it more certainly revealed already;
therefore the revelation can be nothing but an assistance
of the person's faith, or a call to obedience, or
a reproof of some sin; which every man is to believe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">{724}</a></span>
according as there is true evidence that indeed it is
a divine revelation or vision; which if it be not, the
same thing is still sure to us in the Scripture.</p>

<p>3. If it be something that is only besides the
Scripture, (as about events and facts, or prophecies
of what will befall particular places or persons,) we
must first see whether the evidence of a divine revelation
be clear in it or not; and that is known, 1. To
the person himself, by the self-attesting and convincing
power of a divine revelation, which no man
knoweth but he that hath it (and we must be very
cautelous lest we take false conceptions to be such).
2. But to himself and others it is known, (1.) At
present by clear, uncontrolled miracles, which are
God's attestation; which if men show, we are bound
(in this case) to believe them. (2.) For the future,
by the event, when things so plainly come to pass,
as prove the prediction to be of God. He therefore
that giveth you not by certain miracles uncontrolled,
a just proof that he is sent of God, is to be heard
with a suspended belief; you must stay till the event
show whether he say true or not: and not act any
thing in the mean time upon an unproved presumption
either of the truth or falsehood of his words.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_441" id="Ref_441" href="#Foot_441">[441]</a></span></p>

<p>4. If you are in doubt whether that which he
speaketh be contrary to God's word or not, you must
hear him with a proportionable suspicion, and give
no credit to him till you have tried whether it be so
or not.</p>

<p>5. It is a dangerous snare and sin to believe any
one's prophecies or revelations merely because they
are very holy persons, and do most confidently aver
or swear it. For they may be deceived themselves.
As also to take hysterical or melancholy delirations
or conceptions for the revelations of the Spirit of
God, and so to father falsehood upon God.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXV. <i>May one be saved who believeth that the Scripture hath
any mistake or error, and believeth it not all?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The chief part of the answer to this must
be fetched from what is said before about fundamentals.
1. No man can be saved who believeth
not that God is no liar, and that all his word is true;
because indeed he believeth not that there is a God.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_442" id="Ref_442" href="#Foot_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>2. No man can be saved who believeth not the
points that are essential to true godliness; nor any
man that heareth the word, who believeth not all
essential to christianity, or the christian covenant
and religion.</p>

<p>3. A man may be saved who believeth not some
books of Scripture (as Jude, 2&nbsp;Peter, 2&nbsp;John, 3&nbsp;John,
Revelation) to be canonical, or the word of God;
so he heartily believe the rest, or the essentials.</p>

<p>4. He that thinketh that the prophets, sacred
historians, evangelists, and apostles, were guided to
an infallible delivery and recording of all the great,
substantial, necessary points of the gospel, but not
to an infallibility in every by-expression, phrase,
citation, or circumstance, doth disadvantage his own
faith as to all the rest; but yet may be saved, if he believe
the substance with a sound and practical belief.<span

<h3>Quest. CLXVI. <i>Who be they that give too little to the Scripture,
and who too much; and what is the danger of each extreme?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I. It is not easy to enumerate all the errors
on either extreme; but only to give some instances
of each. 1. They give too little to the Scripture who
deny it to be indited by inspiration of the infallible
Spirit of God, and to be wholly true. 2. And they
that detract from some parts or books of it while
they believe the rest. 3. And they that think it is
not given as a law of God, and as a rule of faith and
life. 4. And they that think it is not a universal
law and rule for all the world, but for some parts
only (supposing the predication of it). 5. And they
that think it an imperfect law and rule, which must
be made up with the supplement of traditions or
revelations. 6. And they that think it was adapted
only to the time it was written in, and not to ours,
as not foreseeing what would be. 7. And they that
think it is culpably defective in method. 8. And
they that think it culpably defective in phrase, aptness,
or elegancy of style. 9. And they that think
that it containeth not all that was necessary or fit
for universal determination, of that kind of things
which it doth at all universally determine of; as
e.&nbsp;g. that it made two sacraments, but not all of that
kind that are fit to be made, but hath left men to
invent and make more of the same nature and use.
10. And those that think that it is fitted only to the
learned, or only to the unlearned, only to princes, or
only to subjects, &amp;c. 11. And those that think that
it is but for a time, and then by alteration to be perfected,
as Moses's law was. 12. And those that think
that the pope, princes, or prelates, or any men, may
change or alter it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_444" id="Ref_444" href="#Foot_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<p>II. Those give too much (in bulk, but too little in
virtue) to the Scripture, 1. Who would set them up
instead of the whole law and light of nature, as excluding
this as useless where the Scripture is.</p>

<p>2. And they that feign it to be instead of all
grammars, logic, philosophy, and all other arts and
sciences, and to be a perfect, particular rule for every
ruler, lawyer, physician, mariner, architect, husbandman,
and tradesman, to do his work by.</p>

<p>3. And they that feign it to be fully sufficient to
all men to prove its own authority and truth, without
the subsidiary use of that church history and
tradition which telleth us the supposed matters of
fact, and must help us to know what books are
canonical and what not; and without historical
evidence, that these are the true books which the
prophets and apostles wrote, and the miracles and
providences which have attested them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_445" id="Ref_445" href="#Foot_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>4. And those that think that it is sufficient for its
own promulgation, or the people's instruction, without
the ministry of man to preserve, deliver, translate,
expound, and preach it to the people.</p>

<p>5. And those that think it sufficient to sanctify men,
without the concourse of the Spirit's illumination,
vivification, and inward operation to that end.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_446" id="Ref_446" href="#Foot_446">[446]</a></span></p>

<p>6. And they that say that no man can be saved by
the knowledge, belief, love, and practice of all the
substantial parts of christianity brought to him by
tradition, parents, or preachers, who tell him nothing
of the Scriptures, but deliver him the doctrines
as attested by miracles and the Spirit without any
notice of the book.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_447" id="Ref_447" href="#Foot_447">[447]</a></span></p>

<p>7. And those that say that Scripture alone must
be made use of as to all the history of Scripture
times, and that it is unlawful to make use of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">{725}</a></span>
any other historians (as Josephus and such
others).</p>

<p>8. And they that say, no other books of divinity
but Scripture are useful, yea or lawful to be read of
christians, or at least in the church.</p>

<p>9. And they that say that the Scriptures are so
divine, not only in matter, but in method and style,
as that there is nothing of human (inculpable) imperfection
or weakness in them.</p>

<p>10. And those that say that the logical method,
and the phrase, is as perfect as God was able to make
them.</p>

<p>11. And they that say that all passages in Scripture,
historically related, are moral truths; and so
make the devil's words to Eve, of Job, to Christ, &amp;c.
to be all true.</p>

<p>12. And they that say that all passages in the
Scripture were equally obligatory to all other places
and ages, as to those that first received them, (as the
kiss of peace, the veils of women, washing feet,
anointing the sick, deaconnesses, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>13. And they that make Scripture so perfect a rule
to our belief, that nothing is to be taken for certain,
that cometh to us any other way (as natural knowledge,
or historical).</p>

<p>14. And those that think men may not translate
the Scripture, turn the Psalms into metre, tune
them, divide the Scripture into chapters and verses,
&amp;c. as being derogatory alterations of the perfect
word.</p>

<p>15. And those that think it so perfect a particular
rule of all the circumstances, modes, adjuncts, and
external expressions of and in God's worship, as
that no such may be invented or added by man, that
is not there prescribed; as time, place, vesture,
gesture, utensils, methods, words, and many other
things mentioned before.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_448" id="Ref_448" href="#Foot_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>16. And those that Jewishly feign a multitude of
unproved mysteries to lie in the letters, order, numbers,
and proper names in Scripture (though I
deny not that there is much mystery which we little
observe).</p>

<p>17. They that say that the Scripture is all so plain,
that there are no obscure or difficult passages in
them, which men are in danger of wresting to their
own destruction.</p>

<p>18. And they that say that all in the Scripture is
so necessary to salvation, (even the darkest prophecies,)
that they cannot be saved that understand them
not all; or at least endeavour not studiously and
particularly to understand them.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_449" id="Ref_449" href="#Foot_449">[449]</a></span></p>

<p>19. And they that say that every book and text
must of necessity to salvation be believed to be
canonical and true.</p>

<p>20. And those that say that God hath so preserved
the Scripture, as that there are no various readings
and doubtful texts thereupon,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_450" id="Ref_450" href="#Foot_450">[450]</a></span>
and that no written
or printed copies have been corrupted (when Dr.
Heylin tells us, that the king's printer printed the
seventh commandment, Thou shalt commit adultery).
All these err in over-doing.</p>

<p>III. The dangers of the former detracting from
the Scripture are these: 1. It injureth the Spirit who
is the author of the Scriptures. 2. It striketh at the
foundation of our faith, by weakening the records
which are left us to believe; and imboldeneth men
to sin, by diminishing the authority of God's law;
and weakeneth our hopes, by weakening the promises.
3. It shaketh the universal government of
Christ, by shaking the authority or perfection of the
laws by which he governeth. 4. It maketh way for
human usurpations, and traditions, as supplements
to the holy Scriptures; and leaveth men to contrive
to amend God's word and worship, and make co-ordinate
laws and doctrines of their own. 5. It hindereth
the conviction and conversion of sinners, and
hardeneth them in unbelief, by questioning or weakening
the means that should convince and turn them.
6. It is a tempting men to the cursed adding to God's
word.</p>

<p>IV. The dangers of over-doing here are these: 1. It
leadeth to downright infidelity; for when men find
that the Scripture is imperfect or wanting in that
which they fancy to be part of its perfection, and to
be really insufficient, e.&nbsp;g. to teach men physics,
logic, medicine, languages, &amp;c. they will he apt to
say, It is not of God, because it hath not that which
it pretends to have. 2. God is made the author of
defects and imperfections. 3. The Scripture is exposed
to the scorn and confutation of infidels. 4.
Papists are assisted in proving its imperfection.
But I must stop, having spoke to this point before in
quest. 35, and partly quest. 30, 31, 33, more at
large.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXVII. <i>How far do good men now preach and pray by the
Spirit?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. Not by such inspiration of new matter
from God as the prophets and apostles had which
indited the Scriptures.</p>

<p>2. Not so as to exclude the exercise of reason,
memory, or diligence: which must be as much and
more than about any common things.</p>

<p>3. Not so as to exclude the use and need of Scripture,
ministry, sermons, books, conference, examples,
use, or other means and helps.</p>

<p>But, 1. The Spirit indited that doctrine and Scripture
which is our rule for prayer and for preaching.</p>

<p>2. The Spirit's miracles and works in and by the
apostles seal that doctrine to us, and confirm our faith
in it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_451" id="Ref_451" href="#Foot_451">[451]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The Spirit in our faithful pastors and teachers
teacheth us by them to pray and preach.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_452" id="Ref_452" href="#Foot_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>4. The Spirit by illumination, quickening, and
sanctification, giveth us an habitual acquaintance
with our sins, our wants, with the word of precept
and promise, with God, with Christ, with grace, with
heaven. And it giveth us a habit of holy love to
God, and goodness and thankfulness for mercy and
faith in Christ, and the life to come, and desires of
perfection, and hatred of sin; and he that hath all
these, hath a constant habit of prayer in him; for
prayer is nothing but the expression with the tongue
of these graces in the heart; so that the Spirit
of sanctification is thereby a Spirit of adoption
and of supplication. And he that hath freedom
of utterance can speak that which God's Spirit hath
put into his very heart, and made him esteem his
greatest and nearest concernment, and the most
necessary and excellent thing in all the world.
This is the Spirit's principal help.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_453" id="Ref_453" href="#Foot_453">[453]</a></span></p>

<p>5. The same Spirit doth incline our hearts to the
diligent use of all those means, by which his abilities
may be increased; as to read, and hear, and
confer, and to use ourselves to prayer, and to meditation,
self-examination, &amp;c.</p>

<p>6. The same Spirit helpeth us in the use of all
these means, to profit by them, and to make them all
effectual on our hearts.</p>

<p>7. The same Spirit concurreth with means, habits,
reason, and our own endeavours, to help us in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">{726}</a></span>
very act of praying and preaching. 1. By illuminating
our minds to know what to desire and say. 2.
By actuating our wills to love, and holy desire, and
other affections. 3. By quickening and exciting us
to a liveliness and fervency in all. And so bringing
our former habits into acts, the grace of prayer is
the heart and soul of gifts; and thus the Spirit
teacheth us to pray.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_454" id="Ref_454" href="#Foot_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>Yea, the same Spirit thus by common helps assisteth
even bad men in praying and preaching,
giving them common habits and acts that are short
of special saving grace. Whereas men left to themselves
without God's Spirit, have none of all these
forementioned helps. And so the Spirit is said to
intercede for us by exciting our unexpressible groans;
and to help our infirmities when we know not what
to ask as we ought.<span

books, forms, &amp;c. without the Spirit; or if we ascribe
any thing to any of these which is proper to Christ
or to his Spirit. For such proud, self-sufficient despisers
of the Spirit, cannot reasonably expect his
help. I doubt among men counted learned and
rational there are too many such,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_457" id="Ref_457" href="#Foot_457">[457]</a></span>
that know not
man's insufficiency or corruption, nor the necessity
and use of that Holy Ghost into whose name they
were baptized, and in whom they take on them to
believe. But think that all that pretend to the
Spirit are but fanatics and enthusiasts, and self-conceited
people; when yet the Spirit himself saith,
Rom. viii. 9, "If any man have not the Spirit of
Christ, the same is none of his." And Gal. iv. 6,
"Because we are sons, God hath sent forth the
Spirit of his Son into our hearts, whereby we cry,
Abba, Father."</p>

<p>2. But if we give to reason, memory, study, books,
methods, forms, &amp;c. but their proper place in subordination
to Christ and to his Spirit, they are so far
from being quenchers of the Spirit, that they are
necessary in their places, and such means as we
must use, if ever we will expect the Spirit's help.
For the Spirit is not given to a brute to make him a
man, or rational; nor to a proud despiser, or idle
neglecter of God's appointed means, to be instead of
means; nor to be a patron to the vice of pride or
idleness, which he cometh chiefly to destroy; but to
bless men in their laborious use of the means which
God appointed him: read but Prov. i. 20, &amp;c. ii.
iii. v. vi. viii., and you will see that knowledge
must be laboured for, and instruction heard; and he
that will lie idle till the Spirit move him, and will
not stir up himself to seek God, or strive to enter in
at the strait gate, nor give all diligence to make his
calling and election sure,<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_458" id="Ref_458" href="#Foot_458">[458]</a></span>
may find that the Spirit
of sloth hath destroyed him, when he thought the
Spirit of Christ had been saving him. He that hath
but two articles in his creed, must make this the
second: "For he that cometh to God must believe
that God is, and that he is the rewarder of them that
diligently seek him," Heb. xi. 6.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXIX. <i>How doth the Holy Ghost set bishops over the
churches?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. By making the office itself, so far as the
apostles had any hand in it, Christ himself having
made their office.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_459" id="Ref_459" href="#Foot_459">[459]</a></span></p>

<p>2. The Holy Ghost in the electors and ordainers
directeth them to discern the fitness of the persons
elected and ordained, and so to call such as God
approveth of, and calleth by the Holy Ghost in them.
Which was done, 1. By the extraordinary gift of
discerning in the apostles. 2. By the ordinary help
of God's Spirit in the wise and faithful electors and
ordainers ever since.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_460" id="Ref_460" href="#Foot_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The Holy Ghost doth qualify them for the
work, by due life, light, and love, knowledge, willingness,
and active ability, and so both inclining
them to it, and marking out the persons by his gifts,
whom he would have elected and ordained to it:
which was done, 1. At first by extraordinary gifts.
2. And ever since by ordinary. (1.) Special and
saving in some. (2.) Common, and only fitted to
the church's instruction, in others. So that whoever
is not competently qualified, is not called by the
Holy Ghost: when Christ ascended, he gave "gifts
to men, some apostles, prophets, and evangelists,
some pastors and teachers, for the edifying of his
body," &amp;c. Eph. iv. 7-10.<span

<h3>Quest. CLXX. <i>Are temples, fonts, utensils, church lands, much more
the ministers, holy? And what reverence is due to them as holy?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> The question is either <i>de nomine</i>, whether
it be fit to call them holy; or <i>de re</i>, whether they
have that which is called holiness.</p>

<p>I. The word holy signifieth in God, essential,
transcendent perfection; and so it cometh not into
our question. In creatures it signifieth, 1. A divine
nature in the rational creature, (angels and men,) by
which it is made like God, and disposed to him and
his service, by knowledge, love, and holy vivacity;
which is commonly called real saving holiness as
distinct from mere relative. 2. It is taken for the
relation of any thing to God as his own peculiar appropriated
to him: so infinite is the distance between
God and us, that whatever is his in a special
sense, or separated to his use, is called holy; and
that is, 1. Persons. 2. Things. 1. Persons are
either, (1.) In general devoted to his love and
service. (2.) Or specially devoted to him in some
special office; which is, (1.) Ecclesiastical. (2.)
Economical. (3.) Political. Those devoted to this
general service are, (1.) Either heartily and sincerely
so devoted, (who are ever sanctified in the
first real sense also). (2.) Or only by word or outward
profession. 2. Things devoted to God are, 1.
Some by his own immediate choice, designation, and
command. 2. Or by general directions to man to
do it. And these are, 1. Some things more nearly.
2. Some things more remotely separated to him.
None of these must be confounded; and so we must
conclude,</p>

<p>1. All that shall be saved are really holy by a
divine inclination and nature, and actual exercise
thereof; and relatively holy in a special sense, as
thus devoted and separated to God.</p>

<p>2. All the baptized and professors (not apostate)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">{727}</a></span>
are relatively holy, as verbally devoted and separated
to God.</p>

<p>3. All that are ordained to the sacred ministry are
relatively holy, as devoted and separated to that
office. And the well qualified are also really holy,
as their qualifications are either special or common.</p>

<p>4. All that are duly called of God to the place of
kings, and judges, and rulers of families, are relatively
sacred, as their offices and they are of God
and for him, and devoted to him.</p>

<p>5. Temples and other utensils designed by God
himself, are holy, as related to him by that designation.</p>

<p>6. Temples, utensils, lands, &amp;c. devoted and lawfully
separated by man, for holy uses, are holy, as
justly related to God by that lawful separation. To
say as some do, that They are indeed consecrated
and separated, but not holy, is to be ridiculously
wise by self-contradiction, and the masterly use of
the word holy, contrary to custom and themselves.</p>

<p>7. Ministers are more holy than temples, lands,
or utensils, as being nearlier related to holy
things. And things separated by God himself are
more holy than those justly separated by man. And
so of days.</p>

<p>8. Things remotely devoted to God, are holy in
their distant place and measure; as the meat, drink,
house, lands, labours of every godly man, who with
himself devoteth all to God; but this being more
distant, is yet a remoter degree of holiness.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_462" id="Ref_462" href="#Foot_462">[462]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Uncovered in church and reverent gestures.</div>

<p>II. Every thing should be reverenced
according to the measure of
its holiness; and this expressed by
such signs, gestures, actions, as are fittest to
honour God, to whom they are related; and so to be
uncovered in church, and use reverent carriage and
gestures there, doth tend to preserve due reverence
to God and to his worship, 1&nbsp;Cor. xvi. 20.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXXI. <i>What is sacrilege, and what not?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> I. Sacrilege is robbing God by the unjust
alienation of holy things. And it is measured according
as things are diversified in holiness; as,</p>

<p>1. The greatest sacrilege is a profane, unholy
alienating a person to the flesh and the world, from
God, and his love, and his service, who by baptism
was devoted to him. And so all wicked christians
are grossly sacrilegious.</p>

<p>2. The next is alienating consecrated persons from
the sacred work and office, by deposing kings, or by
unjust silencing or suspending true ministers, or
their casting off God's work themselves. This is far
greater sacrilege than alienating lands or utensils.</p>

<p>3. The next is the unjust alienating of temples,
utensils, lands, days, which were separated by God
himself.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_463" id="Ref_463" href="#Foot_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>4. And next such as were justly consecrated by
man; as is aforesaid in the degrees of holiness.</p>

<p>II. It is not sacrilege, 1. To cease from the ministry
or other holy service, when sickness, disability
of body, or violence, utterly disable us.</p>

<p>2. Nor to alienate temples, lands, goods, or utensils,
when Providence maketh it needful to the
church's good: so the fire in London hath caused a
diminution of the number of churches: so some
bishops of old, sold the church plate to relieve the
poor: and some princes have sold some church lands
to save the church and state in the necessities of a
lawful war.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_464" id="Ref_464" href="#Foot_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>3. It is not sacrilege to alienate that which man
devoted, but God accepted not, nor owned as appropriate
to him (which his prohibition of such a dedication
is a proof of). As if a man devote his wife to
chastity, or his son to the ministry, against their
wills: or if a man vow himself to the ministry that
is unable and hath no call: or if so much lands or
goods be consecrated, as is superfluous, useless, and
injurious to the common welfare and the state.
Alienation in these cases is no sin.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXXII. <i>Are all religious and private meetings, forbidden by
rulers, unlawful conventicles? Or are any such necessary?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ.</i> Though both such meetings and our prisons
tell us how greatly we now differ about this point, in
the application of it to persons and our present case,
yet I know no difference in the doctrinal resolution
of it among most sober christians at all (which
makes our case strange).</p>

<p>For aught I know, we are agreed,</p>

<p>I. 1. That it is more to the honour of the church,
and of religion, and of God, and more to our safety
and edification, to have God's worship performed
solemnly, publicly, and in great assemblies, than in
a corner, secretly, and with few.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_465" id="Ref_465" href="#Foot_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That it is a great mercy therefore where the
rulers allow the church such public worship.</p>

<p>3. That, <i>cæteris paribus</i>, all christians should prefer
such public worship before private; and no private
meetings should be kept up, which are opposite
or prejudicial to such public meetings.</p>

<p>4. And therefore if such meetings (or any that are
unnecessary to the ends of the ministry, the service
of God and good of souls) be forbidden by lawful
rulers, they must be forborne.</p>

<p>II. But we are also agreed, 1. That it is not the
place but the presence of the true pastors and people
that make the church.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_466" id="Ref_466" href="#Foot_466">[466]</a></span></p>

<p>2. That God may be acceptably worshipped in all
places when it is our duty.</p>

<p>3. That the ancient churches and christians in
times of persecutions, ordinarily met in secret against
the ruler's will, and their meetings were called conventicles
(and slandered, which occasioned Pliny's
examination, and the right he did them).</p>

<p>4. That no minister must forsake and give over
his work while there is need, and he can do it.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_467" id="Ref_467" href="#Foot_467">[467]</a></span></p>

<p>5. That where there are many thousands of ignorant
and ungodly persons, and the public ministers,
either through their paucity, (proportioned to the
people,) or their disability, unwillingness, or negligence,
or all, are insufficient for all that public and
private ministerial work, which God hath appointed
for the instruction, persuasion, and salvation of such
necessitous souls, there is need of more ministerial
help.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_468" id="Ref_468" href="#Foot_468">[468]</a></span></p>

<p>6. That in cases of real (not counterfeit) necessity,
they that are hindered from exercising their ministerial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">{728}</a></span>
office publicly, should do it privately, if they
have true ordination, and the call of the people's
necessity, desire, and of opportunity; so be it they
do it in that peaceable, orderly, and quiet manner,
as may truly promote the interest of religion, and
detract not from the lawful public ministry and work.</p>

<p>7. That they that are forbidden to worship God
publicly, unless they will commit some certain sin,
are so prohibited as that they ought not to do it on
such terms.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_469" id="Ref_469" href="#Foot_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>8. That the private meetings which are held on
these forementioned terms, in such cases of necessity,
are not to be forsaken, though prohibited; though
still the honour of the magistrate is to be preserved,
and obedience given him in all lawful things. And
such meetings are not sinful nor dishonourable (to
the assemblies); for as Tertullian (and Dr. Heylin
after him) saith, <i>Cum pii, cum boni coeunt, non factio
dicenda est, sed curia</i>: When pious and good people
meet, (especially as aforesaid,) it is not to be called
a faction, but a court. Thus far I think we all agree.</p>

<p>And that the church of England is really of this
mind is certain; 1. In that they did congregate in
private themselves, in the time of Cromwell's usurpation,
towards the end when he began to restrain the
use of the Common-prayer. 2. In that they wrote
for it: see Dr. Hide "Of the Church," in the beginning.
3. Because both in the reign of former
princes, since the reformation, and to this day, many
laborious conforming ministers have still used to repeat
their sermons in their houses, where many of
the people came to hear them. 4. Because the
liturgy alloweth private baptism, and restraineth not
any number from being present, nor the minister
from instructing them in the use of baptism (which
is the sum of christianity). 5. Because the liturgy
commandeth the visitation of the sick, and alloweth
the minister there to pray and instruct the person
according to his own ability, about repentance, faith
in Christ, and preparation for death and the life to
come, and forbiddeth not the friends and neighbours
of the sick to be present. 6. Because the liturgy
and canons allow private communion with the sick,
lame, or aged that cannot come to the assembly;
where the nature of that holy work is to be opened,
and the eucharistical work to be performed; and
some must be present, and the number not limited.
7. And as these are express testimonies, that all private
meetings are not disallowed by the church of
England, so there are other instances of such natural
necessity as they are not to be supposed to be
against. As, (1.) For a captain to pray, and read
Scripture or good books, and sing psalms with his
soldiers, and with mariners at sea, when they have
no minister. (2.) There are many thousands and
hundred thousands in England, that some live so far
from the church, and some are so weak that they can
seldom go, and some churches have not room for a
quarter of the parish; and none of the thousands
now meant can read, and so neither can help themselves,
nor have a minister that will do it; and thousands
that when they have heard a sermon cannot
remember it, but lose it presently. If these that
cannot read or remember, nor teach their own families,
nor go to church, do take their families, many
of them, to some one neighbour's house where the
sermon is repeated, or the Bible or liturgy read, methinks
the church should not be against it.</p>

<p>But it must be still remembered, that, 1. Rulers
that are infidels, papists, heretics, or persecutors,
that restrain church meetings to the injury of men's
souls, must be distinguished from pious princes that
only restrain heretics and real schismatics for the
church's good. 2. And that times of heresy and
schism may make private meetings more dangerous
than quiet times. And so even the Scottish church
forbad private meeting in the separatists' days of
late. And when they do more hurt than good, and
are justly forbidden, no doubt, in that case, it is a
duty to obey and to forbear them, as is aforesaid.</p>

<h3>Quest. CLXXIII. <i>What particular directions for order of studies,
and books, should be observed by young students?</i></h3>

<p>Because disorder is so great a disadvantage to
young students, and because many have importuned
me to name them some few of the best books, because
they have no time to read, nor money to buy
many, I shall here answer these two demands.</p>

<p>1. The order of their studies is such as respecteth
their whole lives, or such as respecteth every day.
It is the first which I now intend.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> I. The knowledge of so much of theology
as is necessary to your own duty and salvation, is the
first thing which you are to learn (when you have
learnt to speak). Children have souls to save; and
their reason is given them to use for their Creator's
service and their salvation. 1. They can never begin
to learn that too soon which they were made and
redeemed to learn, and which their whole lives must
be employed in practising. 2. And that which absolute
necessity requireth, and without which there
is no salvation. 3. And that which must tell a man
the only ultimate end which he must intend, in all
the moral actions of his life. For the right intention
of our end is antecedent to all right use of means;
and till this be done, a man hath not well begun to
live, nor to use his reason; nor hath he any other
work for his reason, till this be first done. He liveth
but in a continual sin, that doth not make God and
the public good, and his salvation, his end. Therefore
they that would not have children begin with divinity,
would have them serve the devil and the flesh.
God must be our first and last, and all.</p>

<p>Not that any exact or full body or method of divinity
is to be learnt so early. But, 1. The baptismal
covenant must be well opened betimes, and frequently
urged upon their hearts. 2. Therefore the creed,
the Lord's prayer, and decalogue, must be opened to
such betimes; that is, they must be wisely catechised.
3. They must be taught the Scripture history,
especially Genesis and the gospel of Christ. 4. They
must, with the other scriptures, read the most plain
and suitable books of practical divines (after named).
5. They must be kept in the company of suitable,
wise, and exemplary christians, whose whole conversation
will help them to the sense and love of holiness;
and must be kept strictly from perverting,
wicked company. 6. They must be frequently,
lovingly, familiarly, yet seriously, treated with about
the state of their own souls, and made to know their
need of Christ and of his Holy Spirit, of justification
and renovation. 7. They must be trained up in the
practice of godliness, in prayer, pious speeches, and
obedience to God and man. 8. They must be kept
under the most powerful and profitable ministers of
Christ that can be had. 9. They must be much
urged to the study of their own hearts; to know
themselves; what it is to be a man, to have reason,
free-will, and an immortal soul: what it is to be a child
of lapsed Adam, and an unregenerate, unpardoned
sinner: what it is to be a redeemed, and a sanctified,
justified person, and an adopted heir of life eternal.
And by close examination to know which of these
conditions is their own; to know what is their daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">{729}</a></span>
duty; and what their danger, and what their temptations
and impediments, and how to escape.</p>

<p>For if once the soul be truly sanctified, then,
1. Their salvation is much secured, and the main
work of their lives is happily begun, and they are
ready to die safely whenever God shall call them
hence. 2. It will possess them with a right end, in
all the studies and labours of their lives; which is
an unspeakable advantage, both for their pleasing of
God and profiting of themselves and others; without
which they will but profane God's name and word,
and turn the ministry into a worldly, fleshly life, and
study and preach for riches, preferment, or applause,
and live as he, Luke xii. 18, 19, "Soul, take thy
ease, eat, drink, and be merry;" and they will make
theology the way to hell, and study and preach their
own condemnation. 3. A holy heart will be always
under the greatest motives; and therefore will be
constantly and powerfully impelled (as well in secret
as before others) to diligence in studies and all good
endeavours. 4. And it will make all sweet and easy
to them, as being a noble work, and relishing of
God's love, and the endless glory to which it tendeth.
A holy soul will all the year long be employed in
sacred studies and works, as a good stomach at a
feast, with constant pleasure. And then oh how happily
will all go on! When a carnal person with a
dull, unwilling, weary mind, taketh now and then a
little, when his carnal interest itself doth prevail
against his more slothful, sensual inclinations; but
he never followeth it with hearty affections, and
therefore seldom with good success. 4. And a holy
soul will be a continual treasury and fountain of holy
matter, to pour out to others, when they come to the
sacred ministry; so that such a one can say more
from the feeling and experience of his soul, than another
can in a long time gather from his books.
5. And that which he saith will come warm to the
hearers, in a more lively, experimental manner, than
usual carnal preachers speak. 6. And it is liker to
be attended by a greater blessing from God. 7. And
there are many controversies in the church, which
an experienced, holy person (<i>cæteris paribus</i>) hath
great advantage in, above all others, to know the
right, and be preserved from errors.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> II. Let young men's time (till about
eighteen, nineteen, or twenty) be spent in the improvement
of their memories, rather than in studies
that require much judgment. Therefore let them take
that time to get organical knowledge; such as are
the Latin and Greek tongues first and chiefly, and
then the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Arabic; with
the exactest acquaintance with the true precepts of
logic: and let them learn some epitome of logic
without book. In this time also let them be much
conversant in history, both civil, scholastical, (of
philosophers, orators, poets, &amp;c.) and ecclesiastical.
And then take in as much of the mathematics as
their more necessary studies will allow them time
for (still valuing knowledge according to the various
degrees of usefulness).</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> III. When you come to seek after more
abstruse and real wisdom, join together the study of
physics and theology; and take not your physics as
separated from or independent on theology, but as
the study of God in his works, and of his works as
leading to himself. Otherwise you will be but like
a scrivener or printer, who maketh his letters well,
but knoweth not what they signify.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IV. Unite all <span title="ontologia">ὀντολογία</span>, or knowledge of
real entities, into one science; both spirits and bodies;
God being taken in as the first and last, the original,
director, and end of all: and study not the doctrine
of bodies alone, as separated from spirits; for it is
but an imaginary separation, and a delusion to men's
minds. Or if you will call them by the name of
several sciences, be sure you so link those severals
together that the due dependence of bodies on spirits,
and of the passive natures on the active, may still be
kept discernible; and then they will be one while you
call them divers.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> V. When you study only to know what is
true, you must begin at the <i>primum cognoscibile</i>,
and so rise <i>in ordine cognoscendi</i>; but when you
would come to see things in their proper order, by a
more perfect, satisfying knowledge, you must draw
up a synthetical scheme, <i>juxta ordinem essendi</i>, where
God must be the first and last; the first efficient
Governor and End of all.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VI. Your first study of philosophy therefore
should be, of yourselves; to know a man. And
the knowledge of man's soul is a part so necessary,
so near, so useful, that it should take up both the
first and largest room in all your physics, or knowledge
of God's works: labour therefore to be accurate
in this.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VII. With the knowledge of yourselves
join the knowledge of the rest of the works of God;
but according to the usefulness of each part to your
moral duty; and as all are related to God and you.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> VIII. Be sure in all your progress that you
keep a distinct knowledge of things certain and
things uncertain, searchable and unsearchable, revealed
and unrevealed; and lay the first as your
foundation, yea, rather keep the knowledge of them
as your science of physics by itself, and let no obscurity
in the rest cause you to question certain things;
nor ever be so perverse as to try things known, by
things unknown, and to argue <i>a minus notis</i>. Lay no
stress on small or doubtful things.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> IX. Metaphysics as now taken is a mixture
of organical and real knowledge; and part of it
belongeth to logic, (the organical part,) and the rest
is theology, pneumatology, and the highest parts of
ontology, or real science.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> X. In studying philosophy, 1. See that
you neither neglect any helps of those that have gone
before you, under pretence of taking nothing upon
trust, and of studying the naked things themselves
(for if every man must begin all anew, as if he had
been the first philosopher, knowledge will make but
small proficiency). 2. Nor yet stick in the bare belief
of any author whatsoever, but study all things in
their naked natures and proper evidences, though by
the helps that are afforded you by others. For it is
not science, but human belief, else, whoever you
take it from.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XI. So certain are the numerous errors of
philosophers, so uncertain a multitude of their assertions,
so various their sects, and so easy it is for any
to pull down much which the rest have built, and so
hard to set up any comely structure that others in
like manner may not cast down; that I cannot persuade
you to fall in with any one sort or sect, who
yet have published their sentiments to the world.
The Platonists made very noble attempts in their
inquiries after spiritual being; but they run into
many unproved fanaticisms, and into divers errors,
and want the desirable helps of true method. The
wit of Aristotle was wonderful for subtilty and solidity;
his knowledge vast; his method (oft) accurate;
but many precarious, yea erroneous conceptions
and assertions, are so placed by him, as to
have a troubling and corrupting influence into all
the rest. The Epicureans or Democratists were still
and justly the contempt of all the sober sects; and
our late Somatists that follow them, yea, and Gassendus,
and many that call themselves Cartesians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_730" id="Page_730">{730}</a></span>
yea, Cartesius himself, much more Berigardus, Regius,
and Hobbes, do give so much more to mere
matter and motion, than is truly due, and know or
say so much too little of spirits, active natures, vital
powers, which are the true principles of motion,
that they differ as much from true philosophers, as
a carcass or a clock from a living man. The stoics
had noble ethical principles, and they (and the Platonists
with the cynics) were of the best lives; but
their writings are most lost, and little of their physics
fully known to us, and that also hath its errors.
Patricius is but a Platonist so taken with the nature
of light, as insisting on that in fanatical terms, to
leave out a great deal more that must he conjoined.
Telesius doth the like by heat and cold, heaven and
earth, and among many observable things, hath
much that is unsound and of ill consequence. Campanella
hath improved him, and hath many hints of
better principles (especially in his primalities) than
all the rest; but he fanatically runs them up into so
many unproved and vain, yea, and mistaken superstructures,
as that no true body of physics can be
gathered out of all his works. The attempt that
pious Commenius hath made in his small manual
hath much that is of worth; but far short of accurateness.
The Hermetical philosophers have no
true method of philosophy among them; and to make
their three or five principles to be so many elements,
or simple bodies, constituting all compounds, and
form up a system of philosophy on their suppositions,
will be but a trifle, and not to satisfy judicious
minds; especially considering how defective their
philosophy is made by their omissions. Lullius
and his followers fit not their method to the true
order of the matter. Scaliger, Scheggius, Wendeline,
and Sennertus (especially in his Hypomnemata)
were great men, and have many excellent things;
but too much of Aristotle's goeth for current with
them. My worthy, learned, and truly pious friend
Mr. Sam. Gott, in his new book on Gen. i. hath
many excellent notions, and much that is scarce
elsewhere to be met with; but the tedious paragraphs,
the defect of method, and several unproveable
particulars, make it, like all human works, imperfect.</p>

<p>Therefore if I must direct you according to my
judgment, I must advise you, 1. To suppose that
philosophers are all still in very great darkness, and
there is much confusion, defectiveness, error, and
division, and uncertainty among them. 2. Therefore
addict not yourselves absolutely to any sect of
them. 3. Let your first studies of them all leave
room for the changing of your judgment, and do not
too hastily fix on any of their sentiments as sure,
till you have heard what others say, and with ripened
understandings have deeply and long studied the
things themselves. 4. Choose out so much of the
certainties and useful parts of physics as you can
reach to, and make them know their places in subserviency
to your holy principles and ends; and
rather be well content with so much, than to lose
too much time in a vain fatiguing of your brains for
more.</p>

<p>I have made some attempt to draw out so much,
especially <i>de mundo et de homine</i>, in my "Methodus
Theologiæ," though I expect it should no more satisfy
others, than any of theirs have satisfied me.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XII. When you have well stated your
ontology or real science, then review your logic and
organical part of metaphysics; and see that <i>verba
rebus aptentur</i>; fetch then your words and organical
notions from the nature of the things. Abundance
are confounded by taking up logical notions first
which are unsuitable to true physical beings.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIII. Somewhat of ethics may be well
learned of philosophers, but it is nothing to the
Scripture's christian ethics.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIV. Somewhat of artificial rhetoric and
oratory should be known; but the oratory which is
most natural, from the evidence of things, well
managed by a good understanding and elocution,
which hath least of appearing art or affectation, is
ever the most effectual, and of best esteem.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XV. The doctrine of politics, especially
of the nature of government and laws in general, is
of great use to all that will ever understand the nature
of God's government and laws, that is, of religion.
Though there be no necessity of knowing
the government and laws of the land or of other
countries, any further than is necessary to our obedience
or outward concernments, yet so much of
government and laws as nature and Scripture make
common to all particular forms and countries, must
be known by him that will understand morality or
divinity, or will ever study the laws of the land.
And it is a preposterous course, and the way of ignorance
and error, for a divine to study God's laws,
and a lawyer man's laws, before either of them know
in general what a law or what government is, as
nature notifieth it to us.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVI. When you come to divinity, I am not
for their way that would have you begin with the
fathers, and thence form a body of divinity to yourselves:
if every young student must be put on such
a task, we may have many religions quickly, but
shall certainly have much ignorance and error. We
must not be so blind or unthankful to God as to deny
that later times have brought forth abundance of
theological writings, incomparably more methodical,
judicious, full, clear, and excellently fitted also by
application, to the good of souls, than any that are
known to us since the writing of the sacred Scriptures.
Reverence of antiquity hath its proper place
and use, but is not to make men fools, non-proficients,
or contemners of God's greater mercies.</p>

<p>My advice therefore is, that you begin with a
conjunction of English catechisms, and the confessions
of all the churches, and the practical holy
writings of our English divines; and that you never
separate these asunder.<span
class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_470" id="Ref_470" href="#Foot_470">[470]</a></span>
These practical books do
commonly themselves contain the principles, and do
press them in so warm a working manner as is likest
to bring them to the heart; and till they are there,
they are not received according to their use, but
kept as in the porch. Get then six or seven of the
most judicious catechisms, and compare them well
together, and compare all the confessions of the
churches (where you may be sure that they put
those which they account the weightiest and surest
truths). And with them read daily the most spiritual
heart-moving treatises, of regeneration, and
our covenant with God in Christ, of repentance,
faith, love, obedience, hope, and of a heavenly mind
and life; as also of prayer and other particular duties,
and of temptations and particular sins.</p>

<p>And when you have gone through the catechisms,
read over three or four of the soundest systems of
divinity. And after that proceed to some larger
theses, and then to the study of the clearest and
exactest methodists; and think not that you well
understand divinity, till, 1. You know it as methodized
and jointed in a due scheme, and the
several parts of it in their several schemes, seeing
you know not the beauty or the true sense of things,
if you know them not in their proper places, where
they stand in their several respects to other points:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">{731}</a></span>
and, 2. Till it be wrought into your very hearts,
and digested into a holy nature; for when all is done,
it is only a holy and heavenly life, that will prove
you wise, and make you happy, and give you solid
peace and comfort.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVII. When you have gone so far, set
yourselves to read the ancients: 1. And take them
in order as they lived. 2. Observe most the historical
parts, what doctrines and practices <i>de facto</i> did
then obtain. 3. Some must be read wholly, and
some but in part. 4. Councils and church history
here have a chief place.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XVIII. With them read the best commentators
on the Scriptures, old and new.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XIX. And then set yourselves to the
study of church controversies (though those that the
times make necessary must be sooner looked into).
Look first and most into those which your own consciences
and practice require your acquaintance
with: and above all here, read well those writings
that confute atheists and infidels, and most solidly
prove the truth of the christian religion; and then
those that defend the greatest points. And think
not much to bestow some time and labour in reading
some of the old school divines.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XX. When you come to form up your belief
of certainties in religion, take in nothing as sure
and necessary, which the ancient churches did not
receive. Many other things may be taken for
truths; and in perspicuity and method the late times
much excel them; but christian religion is still the
same thing, and therefore we must have no other religion
in the great and necessary parts than they had.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXI. Still remember, that men's various
capacities do occasion a great variety of duties.
Some men have clear and strong understandings by
nature; these should study things as much as books;
for possibly they may excel and correct their authors.
Some are naturally of duller or less judicious heads,
that with no study of things can reach half so high,
as they may do by studying the writings of those
who are wiser than ever they are like to be. These
must take more on trust from their authors, and confess
their weakness.</p>

<p><i>Direct.</i> XXII. After or with all controversies, be
well versed in the writings of those reconcilers who
pretend to narrow or end the differences. For usually
they are such as know more than the contenders.</p>

<p>I proceed now to give you some names of books.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_470" id="Foot_470" href="#Ref_470">[470]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I mention not your reading the Scripture, as supposing
it must be your constant work.</p>

</div>

<h3>Quest. CLXXIV. <i>What books, especially of theology, should one
choose, who for want of money or time can read but few?</i></h3>

<p><i>Answ. General.</i> The truth is, 1. It is not the reading
of many books which is necessary to make a
man wise or good; but the well reading of a few,
could he be sure to have the best. 2. And it is not
possible to read over very many on the same subjects,
without a great deal of loss of precious time;
3. And yet the reading of as many as is possible
tendeth much to the increase of knowledge, and were
the best way, if greater matters were not that way
unavoidably to be omitted: life therefore being
short, and work great, and knowledge being for love
and practice, and no man having leisure to learn all
things, a wise man must be sure to lay hold on that
which is most useful and necessary. 4. But some
considerable acquaintance with many books is now become
by accident necessary to a divine. 1. Because
unhappily a young student knoweth not which are
the best, till he hath tried them; and when he should
take another man's word, he knoweth not whose word
it is that he should take: for among grave men, accounted
great scholars, it is few that are truly judicious
and wise, and he that is not wise himself cannot
know who else are so indeed: and every man will
commend the authors that are of his own opinion.
And if I commend you to some authors above others,
what do I but commend my own judgment to you,
even as if I commended my own books, and persuaded
you to read them; when another man of a
different judgment will commend to you books of a
different sort? And how knoweth a raw student
which of us is in the right? 2. Because no man is
so full and perfect as to say all that is said by all
others; but though one man excel in one or many
respects, another may excel him in some particulars,
and say that which he omitteth, or mistaketh in.
3. But especially because many errors and adversaries
have made many books necessary to some, for
to know what they say, and to know how to confute
them, especially the papists, whose way is upon pretence
of antiquity and universality, to carry every
controversy into a wood of church history, and ancient
writers, that there you may first be lost, and
then they may have the finding of you: and if you
cannot answer every corrupted or abused citation of
theirs out of councils and fathers, they triumph as
if they had justified their church tyranny. 4. And
the very subjects that are to be understood are numerous,
and few men write of all. 5. And on the
same subject men have several modes of writing;
as one excelleth in accurate method, and another in
clear, convincing argumentation, and another in an
affectionate, taking style: and the same book that
doth one, cannot well do the other, because the same
style will not do it.</p>

<p><i>Object.</i> But the ancient fathers used not so many
books as we do, no, not one for our hundreds: and
yet we honour them above the Neoterics: they
lived before these libraries had a being. Yea, they
exhort divines to be learned in the holy Scriptures,
and the fourth council of Carthage forbad the reading
of the heathens' books: and many heretics are
accused by the fathers and historians, as being studied
in logic, and curious in common sciences; and
Paul saith, that the Scriptures are able to make us
wise unto salvation.</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> 1. And yet the New Testament was written
(or most of it) after the Scriptures which Paul is
commonly supposed to mean, and some of it, after
he said so, which showeth that he meant not to exclude
more writing.</p>

<p>2. The Scriptures are sufficient for their proper
use, which is to be a law of faith and life, if they
be understood. But, 1. They are not sufficient for
that which they were never intended for: 2. And
we may by other books be greatly helped in understanding
them.</p>

<p>3. If other books were not needful, teachers were
not needful; for writing is but the most advantageous
way of teaching by fixed characters, which fly
not from our memory as transient words do. And
who is it that understandeth the Scriptures that
never had a teacher? And why said the eunuch,
"How should I (understand what I read) unless
some man guide me?" Acts viii. 31. And why did
Christ set teachers in his church to the end, till it
be perfected? Eph. iv. 11-13, if they must not
teach the church unto the end. Therefore they
may write unto the end.</p>

<p>4. Reverence to antiquity must not make us blind
or unthankful. Abundance of the fathers were unlearned
men, and of far less knowledge than ordinary
divines have now; and the chief of them were
far short in knowledge of the chiefest that God of
late hath given us. And how should it be otherwise,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">{732}</a></span>
when their helps were so much less than
ours?</p>

<p>5. Knowledge hath abundantly increased since
printing was invented; therefore books have been a
means to it.</p>

<p>6. The fathers then wrote voluminously; therefore
they were not against more writing.</p>

<p>7. Most of the bishops and councils that cried
down common learning, had little of it themselves,
and therefore knew not how to judge of it; no more
than good men now that want it.</p>

<p>8. They lived among heathens that gloried so in
their own learning, as to oppose it to the word of
God (as may be seen in Julian, and Porphyry, and
Celsus): therefore christians opposed it, and contemned
it; and were afraid while it was set in competition
with the Scriptures, lest it should draw men
to infidelity, if overvalued.</p>

<p>9. And finally, the truth is, that the sacred Scriptures
are now too much undervalued, and philosophy
much overvalued by many both as to evidence and
usefulness: and a few plain, certain truths which all
our catechisms contain, well pressed and practised,
would make a better church and christians, than is
now to be found among us all. And I am one that
after all that I have written, do heartily wish that
this were the ordinary state of our churches. But
yet by accident much more is needful, as is proved:
1. For the fuller understanding of these principles.
2. For the defending of them (especially by those
that are called to that work). 3. To keep a minister
from that contempt which may else frustrate his labours.
4. And to be ornamental and subservient to
the substantial truths.</p>

<p>And now I will answer the question more particularly
in this order.</p>

<p>I. I will name you the poorest or smallest library
that is tolerable.</p>

<p>II. The poorer (though not the poorest); where
a competent addition is made.</p>

<p>III. The poor man's library, which yet addeth
somewhat to the former, but cometh short of a rich
and sumptuous library.</p>

the best). 3. A sound Commentary or Annotations,

<p><i>Note</i> 1. That these may seem too many, though
they are few to a full and rich library.</p>

<p>2. That it is not my advice that you read over all
these, or half; for that would but make them a snare
for sinning, and waste of time: but a minister of the
gospel should have more books by him than he can
read over, for particular uses, and to see the author's
judgment occasionally, and to try other men's citations.</p>

<p>3. That a minister must neither study the matter
without the help of other men's studies by reading
much; nor yet read much without studying the
thing itself.</p>

<p>4. That though a man must not speak or write
before he knoweth what and how, yet thus exercising
the knowledge that we have doth greatly increase
it. And no minister must be studying, when he
should be preaching, praying, catechising, or visiting,
or instructing his flock.</p>

<p>5. It is but few men that are born with an acumen
fit for writings and controversies; those few must
read the more to be fit for it; the rest may take up
with such preparations as they have use for, and
exercise them, viz. in the pastoral oversight of the
flocks, and propagating plain and necessary truths.
And therefore though I am one that have been
thought to burden men's understandings with methods,
distinctions, directions, and controversies, it is but
few that I persuade to use them; and am as much
as any for most men's adhering to plain fundamentals,
and truths of daily use, and love and honour those that
go no further, and are faithful in this work; so be it
they have not the pride to think that they know more
than they do, and to wrangle against that which
they understand not, and set not the church on fire
as ancient ignorance did, by accusing those of heresy
that knew more than themselves, when they got but
the throne or the major vote.</p>

<p>6. That though I chiefly commend systems of
theology, I know not one whose method satisfieth
me, as well agreeing with Scripture, and the matter
(else I had not troubled myself so much to seek a
right method, and propose what I found). And I
think no common method more genuine, than theirs
that expound the creed, Lord's prayer, and decalogue,
and the sacraments, as the sum of all.</p>

<p>7. I mention none of my own writings, for it will
seem vanity; but, as many as they are, I wrote none
which I thought needless at the time of writing
them.</p>

<p>8. Though none should have so great fitness for
the holy education of children and government of
families as ministers, yet so great is the work of
overseeing the flock, requiring more time and parts
than all that we have, and so great are the matters of
our studies and labours, requiring our total and most
serious thoughts, that I earnestly advise all that can
possibly, to live single and without a family, lest they
mar their work by a divided mind: For <i>nunquam
bene fit, quod fit præoccupato animo</i>, saith Hierom
truly.</p>

<p>The whole man and whole time is all too little in
so great a work.</p>

<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>The text of Part III of A Christian Directory (or, a sum of Practical
Theology and Cases of Conscience) has been transcribed from pages 547
to 736 of Volume I of Baxter's Practical Works, as lithographed from
the 1846 edition. Part III addresses church duties. A table of
contents has been inserted to assist the reader.</p>

<p>The anchors for footnotes 119, 366 and 391 are missing. The first of
these has been inserted after consulting another edition of the text.
The reference in footnote 417 to the Book of Acts appears to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in hyphenation, and apparent typographical errors,
have been corrected.</p>
